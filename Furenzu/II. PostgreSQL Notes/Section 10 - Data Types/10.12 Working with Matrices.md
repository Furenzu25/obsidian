## üìö PostgreSQL Study Notes: Arrays (Matrices)

### üîπ What Are Arrays in PostgreSQL?

Arrays in PostgreSQL (sometimes referred to as "matrices") are a data type used to store multiple values in a single field. They are especially useful for:

- Storing intermediate data.
    
- Using within aggregate functions.
    
- Simplifying queries with the `IN` clause.
    
- Representing structured data compactly.
    

---

### üîπ Basic Syntax & Usage

#### ‚úÖ Declaring Arrays

PostgreSQL automatically creates a corresponding array type for each data type:

- `INTEGER` ‚Üí `INTEGER[]`
    
- `CHARACTER` ‚Üí `CHARACTER[]`
    
- And so on.
    

#### ‚úÖ Creating a Simple Array
	
	sql
	
`SELECT ARRAY[2001, 2012, 2003];`

Returns a one-column result with an array of integers.

#### ‚úÖ Creating an Array from Composite Types

You can select multiple values as an array of composite records:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT ROW('Alex', 46), ROW('Maria', 43);`

Or use aliases to name the columns:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT 'Alex'::TEXT AS name, 46 AS age;`

---

### üîπ Converting Strings to Arrays

#### ‚úÖ Using `string_to_array`

Converts delimited strings into an array:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT string_to_array('red,green,blue', ',');`

---

### üîπ Aggregating Values into Arrays

#### ‚úÖ Using `array_agg`

This aggregate function groups multiple values into an array:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT array_agg(some_column) FROM some_table;`

Useful for grouping data within a query result.

---

### üîπ Working with Multidimensional Arrays

You can build multi-dimensional arrays from single-dimension arrays. However, be cautious of unbalanced dimensions, which may lead to `NULL` placeholders.

---

### üîπ Expanding Arrays into Rows

#### ‚úÖ Using `unnest` function

The `unnest()` function turns an array into a set of rows:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT unnest(ARRAY['one', 'two', 'three']);`

#### ‚úÖ Combining with Multiple Columns

You can `unnest` multiple arrays side-by-side:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM unnest(ARRAY['A', 'B', 'C'], ARRAY[1, 2, 3]);`

Each element of the arrays will be matched by index in the result rows.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: If arrays are not the same length, shorter arrays will result in `NULL` for missing values.

---

### üîπ Limitations

- `unnest()` can **only be used in the `FROM` clause**.
    
- Arrays with uneven lengths can produce confusing results due to `NULL`s filling in the gaps.
    

---

### üîπ Key Takeaways

- Arrays allow for powerful data aggregation and transformation in PostgreSQL.
    
- They're ideal for storing multiple values in a single field or breaking out values into rows.
    
- Functions like `array_agg`, `unnest`, and `string_to_array` are essential tools for working with arrays.
    
- Multidimensional arrays and their manipulations should be used carefully to avoid unbalanced data.

### üìò Final Tip

Always refer to the [PostgreSQL official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-array.html) for more advanced examples, especially when working with custom types, complex queries, or JSON/array integrations.
