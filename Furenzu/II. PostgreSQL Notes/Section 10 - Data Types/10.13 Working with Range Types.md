## ðŸ“š PostgreSQL Study Notes: Range Types

### ðŸ”¹ What Are Range Types?

**Range types** in PostgreSQL represent a range of values, defined by a **start** and an **end** point. These are very useful for working with:

- Dates and timestamps
    
- Numbers (integers, decimals)
    
- Any continuous data type
    

Before range types, handling intervals required manual logic using separate columns and custom functions, which were often inefficient and error-prone.

### ðŸ”¹ Range Syntax Basics

PostgreSQL uses brackets to define the **inclusiveness** of the range:

- `[` or `]` means **inclusive**
    
- `(` or `)` means **exclusive**
    

#### âœ… Example:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT '[1,5)'::int4range;`

This means:

- Includes **1**
    
- Excludes **5**
    
- So the values are: 1, 2, 3, 4

### ðŸ”¹ Creating Ranges

You can create ranges using **range constructors**:

	sql

`int4range(lower_bound, upper_bound, '[)' or '()' or '[]')`

You can also use ranges with **dates**:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT daterange('2020-05-01', '2020-08-13', '[)');`

This range includes:

- May 1, 2020
    
- Up to **but not including** August 13, 2020

### ðŸ”¹ Range Data Types

Common built-in range types include:

- `int4range`: Range of integers
    
- `numrange`: Range of numerics
    
- `daterange`: Range of dates
    
- `tsrange`: Range of timestamps (without timezone)
    
- `tstzrange`: Range of timestamps (with timezone)
    

---

### ðŸ”¹ Storing Ranges in Tables

Instead of having separate `start_date` and `end_date` columns, use a single **range column**.

#### âœ… Example: Job History Table
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE employment (   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,   employee VARCHAR(20),   period DATERANGE );`

You can also index this range for performance using:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE INDEX ON employment USING GIST (period);`

#### âœ… Inserting data:
	
	sql
	
`INSERT INTO employment (employee, period) VALUES ('Alex', daterange('2012-04-24', NULL));`

This defines a range from a specific date **to the present (open-ended)**.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Common Range Operators

1. **Overlap (`&&`)**
    
    - Returns `TRUE` if two ranges have values in common.
	        
			sql
		    
    `SELECT * FROM employment WHERE period && daterange('2020-01-01', '2020-12-31');`
    
2. **Contains (`@>`)**
    
    - Checks if the range **contains a specific value**.
	        
			sql
		    
    `SELECT * FROM employment WHERE period @> CURRENT_DATE;`
    

These operators allow powerful filtering and searching in time-based or numeric data.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Practical Use Case

You can use the **overlap operator** to find coworkers with overlapping job periods:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT e1.employee AS emp1, e2.employee AS emp2 FROM employment e1, employment e2 WHERE e1.period && e2.period AND e1.employee <> e2.employee;`

This query helps identify who worked at the company at the same time.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Key Takeaways

- Range types simplify logic for period-based data like employment, scheduling, or events.
    
- You can create **cleaner schemas** and avoid separate start/end columns.
    
- Range types support **indexing**, which boosts performance in large datasets.
    
- **Functions and operators** like `@>`, `&&`, and constructor functions make working with ranges intuitive and flexible.

### ðŸ“˜ Final Tip

For more advanced features and edge cases (like infinite bounds and exclusive intervals), always refer to the official [PostgreSQL documentation on range types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/rangetypes.html). Practice with real examples to deepen your understanding.
