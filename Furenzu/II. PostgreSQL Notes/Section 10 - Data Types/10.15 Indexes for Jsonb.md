## ðŸ“š PostgreSQL Study Notes: Indexing JSONB for Performance

### ðŸ”¹ Overview

In this class, the focus was on **benchmarking different indexes** when used with the **JSONB** data type in PostgreSQL. While JSONB itself doesn't change how we insert or query data, **indexing** can significantly improve **performance**â€”especially when working with large datasets.

### ðŸ”¸ Why Index JSONB?

- **Faster query performance**
    
- **Less memory usage**
    
- **More efficient reads and writes**
    
- Especially helpful in **large-scale databases** with **thousands or millions of records**

### ðŸ”¸ Step-by-Step Process in the Class

1. **Download a Large JSON Dataset**
    
    - Used `wget` to download a `.gz` file containing JSON-formatted data.
        
    - Unzipped using `gzip -d`.
        
    - This dataset was used for performance testing.
        
2. **Create Database and Table**
    
    - Created a database named `store`.
        
    - Created a table called `views` with a `content` column of type `JSONB`.
        
3. **Insert Data**
    
    - Used the `COPY` command to import the large JSON file into the `views` table.
        
    - Example:
	        
			sql
	        
        `COPY views(content) FROM '/path/to/file.json';`
        
    - The content was automatically stored as JSONB for performance benchmarking.

### ðŸ”¸ Index Types Tested

The class tested **four types of indexes**:

#### 1. **BTree Index**

- Traditional indexing method.
    
- Fast creation and good for simple key-value searches.
    
- **Query result: 15 ms â†’ 83 ms â†’ 4 ms** (depending on operator and structure)
    

#### 2. **Hash Index**

- Introduced with better reliability in PostgreSQL 10+.
    
- Faster than BTree for **exact match** queries.
    
- **Query result: ~3 ms**
    

#### 3. **GIN (Generalized Inverted Index)**

- Suitable for JSONB documents with many keys and deep nesting.
    
- Takes **longer to create** but excels in complex queries.
    
- **Query result: ~29 ms**
    

#### 4. **GIN with JSONB Path Ops (Function-Based Index)**

- More optimized for JSONB-specific structures.
    
- Slightly better performance than regular GIN.
    
- **Query result: ~22 ms**

### ðŸ”¸ How Performance Was Measured

- Used the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command to assess:
    
    - **Execution time (ms)**
        
    - **Buffers and hits**
        
    - **Cost and loops**
        
- Took screenshots (as part of class work) to compare results visually.
    

---

### ðŸ”¸ Key Observations

- Even with the **same SELECT query**, different indexes gave **different execution times**.
    
- **Choosing the right index** can reduce query time **from 83 ms to 3 ms**.
    
- **Index creation time varies**, but **query speed** is the focus in real-world applications.
    
- This difference may seem small, but at **scale**, it matters significantly (e.g., in servers handling thousands of concurrent queries).

### ðŸ”¸ Conclusion

- Indexing JSONB data is essential for **efficient querying**.
    
- Each index type serves a **different use case**:
    
    - Use **BTree** or **Hash** for simple, fast lookups.
        
    - Use **GIN** or **Function-based GIN** for **document-like structures** or complex queries.
        
- **Experiment and benchmark** based on your dataset and query patterns.
