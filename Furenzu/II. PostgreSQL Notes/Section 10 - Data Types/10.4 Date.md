# 📚 Study Notes: Working with Dates in PostgreSQL

## 🗓️ Introduction to Date Handling

PostgreSQL provides powerful functionality for handling **dates and times**. Dates can be stored, formatted, and used in calculations such as age, time in service, and more.

## 🔢 Storage and Range

- PostgreSQL stores date values using **4 bytes**.
    
- Supported range: **From 4713 BC to 5874897 AD**.
    
- Dates are stored with **day-level precision**, unlike timestamps which store microseconds.

## 🏗️ Creating Tables with Date Fields

### Example 1: Documents Table
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE documents (   document_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,   header TEXT,   posting_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE );`

- `posting_date`: Uses `DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE` to automatically insert today’s date.
    
- **System Date**: Pulled from the server. Ensure the system clock and time zone are correct.
    

### Example 2: Employees Table
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE employees (   employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,   first_name TEXT,   last_name TEXT,   birth DATE NOT NULL,   admission DATE NOT NULL );`

---

## 🧾 Inserting Data with Dates

You can insert dates in various formats:
	
	sql
	
`INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, birth, admission) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', '1980-05-15', '2005-08-01');`

PostgreSQL accepts multiple date formats:

- `'YYYY-MM-DD'` (standard)
    
- `'MM/DD/YYYY'`
    
- `'Month DD, YYYY'` (e.g., April 28, 2021)
    
- `'DD Month YYYY'` (e.g., 28 April 2021)
    

All these formats are valid as long as they follow logical structure and localization.

## 🔍 Retrieving Dates

### 1. View All Data
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM employees;`

### 2. Get Current Date and Time
	
	sql
	
`SELECT NOW();         -- Full date and time SELECT CURRENT_DATE;  -- Only current date`

### 3. Format a Date

Use double colon `::` to cast a value:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT NOW()::DATE;`

You can also use formatting functions to change output layout:
	
	sql
	
`TO_CHAR(NOW(), 'MM/DD/YYYY')      -- 04/28/2021 TO_CHAR(NOW(), 'Month DD, YYYY')  -- April 28, 2021`

---

## 🧮 Date Calculations

### 1. Time in Service (Days Since Admission)
	
	sql
	
`SELECT    first_name,   NOW()::DATE - admission AS service_days FROM employees;`

### 2. Calculating Age

Use PostgreSQL’s built-in `AGE()` function:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT    first_name,   AGE(NOW(), birth) AS age FROM employees;`

This will return output like `41 years 2 mons 17 days`.

You can also calculate age at a specific point in time:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT    AGE(DATE '2015-01-01', birth) FROM employees;`

---

## 📤 Extracting Parts of a Date

Use the `EXTRACT()` function to get specific parts of a date:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT   EXTRACT(YEAR FROM birth) AS birth_year,   EXTRACT(MONTH FROM birth) AS birth_month,   EXTRACT(DAY FROM birth) AS birth_day FROM employees;`

> You can also extract: `WEEK`, `QUARTER`, `DOW` (day of week), `DOY` (day of year), etc.

## 📌 Summary of Key Date Functions

|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|`CURRENT_DATE`|Gets today’s date|
|`NOW()`|Gets current timestamp (date + time)|
|`AGE(date1, date2)`|Returns age/difference between two dates|
|`EXTRACT(field FROM date)`|Extracts year, month, day, etc. from a date|
|`TO_CHAR(date, format)`|Formats a date to a custom string|
|`::DATE`|Casts value to a date|

---

## ✅ Final Tips

- Always check your **server's time zone** when using date functions.
    
- Use **default values** like `CURRENT_DATE` for automatic timestamping.
    
- Use **age and extract functions** for dynamic date-based analysis (e.g., calculating work experience or birth years).
    
- PostgreSQL supports a **wide range of date formats** and has **extensive date-related functions** documented officially.
