## üïí Study Notes: Understanding `TIMESTAMP` and `TIMESTAMPTZ` in PostgreSQL

### üìò Introduction

In this session, we explore **temporal data types** in PostgreSQL, focusing on:

- `TIMESTAMP`
    
- `TIMESTAMPTZ` (Timestamp with Time Zone)
    

---

### üß© Key Concepts

#### 1. **Data Types Overview**

|Data Type|Description|Time Zone Support|
|---|---|---|
|`TIMESTAMP`|Stores date and time **without time zone awareness**|‚ùå No|
|`TIMESTAMPTZ`|Stores date and time **with time zone awareness**|‚úÖ Yes|

- Both data types store date-time values using **8 bytes**.
    
- When you use `TIMESTAMPTZ`, the value is internally stored in **UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)** and displayed based on your session‚Äôs time zone.
    
- `TIMESTAMP` keeps the date and time fixed, unaffected by time zone settings.

### üß™ Practical Examples

#### üèóÔ∏è Creating a Table with Timestamps
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE team_demo (   ts  TIMESTAMP,   tg  TIMESTAMPTZ );`

#### üåê Setting the Time Zone
	
	sql
	
`SET TIMEZONE TO 'America/Sao_Paulo'; SHOW TIMEZONE;`

#### ‚ûï Inserting Values
	
	sql
	
`INSERT INTO team_demo (tg, ts)  VALUES (   '2016-06-22 19:10:25',    '2016-06-22 19:10:25' );`

#### üîç Viewing Inserted Data
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM team_demo;`

- You‚Äôll observe:
    
    - The `ts` value remains as entered.
        
    - The `tg` value (with time zone) is adjusted according to the current time zone.
        

#### üîÑ Changing the Session Time Zone
	
	sql
	
`SET TIMEZONE TO 'America/New_York'; SELECT * FROM team_demo;`

- Now, only the `tg` (TIMESTAMPTZ) column reflects the new time zone.  
    The `ts` column stays the same.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Getting Current Date and Time

#### Current Timestamp
	
	sql
	
`SELECT NOW();              -- Returns date + time + timezone SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;  -- Same as NOW()`

#### Day and Time Info
	
	sql
	
`SELECT TIMEOFDAY();   -- Example output: 'Friday, April 30, 2021, 11:30 AM'`

---

### üåç Time Zone Conversion

#### Viewing and Converting Time Zones
	
	sql
	
`SHOW TIMEZONE;  -- Convert a specific timestamp to a target time zone SELECT TIMEZONE('America/Sao_Paulo', '2021-04-30 00:00:00');`

- This command **converts a UTC or base timestamp** to a **target time zone**.
    
- Useful for localization or adjusting based on user regions.

### üß† Summary: When to Use What?

|Use Case|Data Type|
|---|---|
|Need to track time across global users|`TIMESTAMPTZ`|
|Fixed local time needed regardless of zone|`TIMESTAMP`|

---

### üßæ Final Notes

- PostgreSQL handles both types efficiently, with internal storage optimizations.
    
- When building apps with global relevance, `TIMESTAMPTZ` is recommended.
    
- Use `SET TIMEZONE` wisely in sessions to observe differences in data output.
    
- You can explore more timestamp functions in the PostgreSQL documentation.
