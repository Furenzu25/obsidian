## ðŸ“š **Study Notes: Creating and Using Functions in PostgreSQL**

---

### ðŸ”¹ **What Are Functions in a Database?**

- Functions (also known as _stored procedures_) are reusable blocks of code stored within the database.
    
- They allow you to **automate**, **encapsulate**, and **reuse logic**, such as queries or operations that would otherwise be repeated multiple times.

### ðŸ”¹ **Syntax Overview: CREATE FUNCTION**
	
	sql
	
`CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION function_name(parameters) RETURNS return_type AS $$ DECLARE   -- variable declarations (optional) BEGIN   -- function logic (SQL statements) END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;`

#### Key Components:

- `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION`: Creates a new function or replaces an existing one.
    
- **Function Name**: Chosen by the developer.
    
- **Parameters**: Optional input values inside parentheses.
    
- `RETURNS`: Specifies the data type the function will return.
    
- `LANGUAGE`: Specifies the language used (e.g., `plpgsql` for PostgreSQLâ€™s procedural language).
    
- **BEGIN...END**: Encloses the function logic.
    
- `$...$`: Marks the start and end of the function body (can use `$$` or `$BODY$`).

### ðŸ”¹ **Basic Example: Return All Rows from a Table**
	
	sql
	
`CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_people() RETURNS SETOF individual AS $$ BEGIN   RETURN QUERY SELECT * FROM individual; END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;`

#### Notes:

- `SETOF` indicates the function returns multiple rows from the `individual` table.
    
- The function can be called like this:
	    
		sql
	    
    `SELECT * FROM get_people();`

### ðŸ”¹ **Advanced Example: Filter by Movie Length**

Function to count movies whose duration falls between two values.
	
	sql
	
`CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION view_movie_time(from_length INT, to_length INT) RETURNS INT AS $$ DECLARE   movie_count INT; BEGIN   SELECT COUNT(*) INTO movie_count   FROM film   WHERE length BETWEEN from_length AND to_length;    RETURN movie_count; END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;`

#### Purpose:

- Performs a filtered count on the `film` table based on movie length.

### ðŸ”¹ **Function Calling Methods**

There are **three main ways** to call functions in PostgreSQL:

1. **Positional Notation**
	    
		sql
	    
    `SELECT view_movie_time(40, 90);`
    
    - Parameters are passed in the exact order defined in the function.
        
2. **Named Notation**
	    
		sql
	    
    `SELECT view_movie_time(from_length => 40, to_length => 90);`
    
    - Parameters are passed using their names, useful when many arguments are involved.
        
3. **Mixed Notation**
	    
		sql
	    
    `SELECT view_movie_time(40, to_length => 90);`
    
    - Combines both styles, but **positional arguments must come first**.
        
    - Reversing the order (named before positional) results in an **error**.

### ðŸ”¹ **Benefits of Using Functions**

- **Efficiency**: Save time by grouping logic into a single callable unit.
    
- **Readability**: Reduces clutter and repetition in queries.
    
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update logic in one place rather than across multiple queries.
    
- **Advanced Use Cases**:
    
    - Automate e-commerce processes (e.g., checking stock, confirming payments).
        
    - Build more complex workflows and data manipulations.

### ðŸ”¹ **Supported Languages**

- PostgreSQL functions are primarily written in **PL/pgSQL**, but also support:
    
    - **Python**
        
    - **C**
        
    - **Perl**
        
    - **Java**
        
- Choosing a language depends on your use case and preferred ecosystem.

### âœ… **Summary**

- Functions allow developers to encapsulate logic and reuse it efficiently.
    
- PostgreSQL provides flexible syntax for creating, calling, and managing these functions.
    
- This foundational understanding opens the door to advanced data processing, automation, and application logic.

### ðŸ”” **Tips for Learning**

- Donâ€™t stress over syntax right away â€” focus on understanding the logic first.
    
- Practice writing and testing simple functions before moving to more complex ones.
    
- Refer to PostgreSQLâ€™s official documentation when in doubt.
    
- Participate in forums or course discussions if you have questions.
