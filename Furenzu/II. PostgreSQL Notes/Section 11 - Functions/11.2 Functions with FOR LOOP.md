# **PostgreSQL Study Notes: Using FOR Loops in Functions**

## **1. Introduction to FOR Loops**

- A **FOR loop** is a control structure used to **repeat a set of commands** until a certain condition is met.
    
- It's commonly used in many programming languages (e.g., Fortran, COBOL, Python).
    
- PostgreSQL supports `FOR` loops within **functions** using PL/pgSQL.
    

---

## **2. Basic Structure of a FOR Loop**

- The `FOR` loop acts as a **counter** that runs **from a start value to an end value**, optionally increasing or decreasing by a step value.
    
- It evaluates a condition:
    
    - If **true**, the loop continues.
        
    - If **false**, it terminates.
        

### **Syntax Example:**
	
	sql
	
`DO $$ BEGIN   FOR counter IN 1..5 LOOP     RAISE NOTICE 'Counter: %', counter;   END LOOP; END; $$;`

- `DO $$ BEGIN...END $$;` is an anonymous code block.
    
- `RAISE NOTICE` is used to **print output** during loop execution (similar to console logs).

## **3. Reverse and Step in FOR Loops**

- You can iterate **in reverse** using `REVERSE`:
	    
		sql
	    
    `FOR i IN REVERSE 5..1 LOOP`
    
- Use `BY` to set a **step** (increment):
	    
		sql
	    
    `FOR i IN 1..6 BY 2 LOOP`
    
    This iterates: 1, 3, 5 (skips every 2).
    

---

## **4. Creating Schemas, Tables, and Functions**

- To use FOR loops meaningfully, you'll often:
    
    1. Create a **schema**.
        
    2. Create a **table** inside that schema.
        
    3. Insert **sample data**.
        
    4. Write a **function** to loop through the data.
        

### **Example: Creating a Phone Table**
	
	sql
	
`CREATE SCHEMA phone; CREATE TABLE phone.phones (   number INT PRIMARY KEY,   operator TEXT );  INSERT INTO phone.phones VALUES   (11, 'Operator A'),   (22, 'Operator B'),   (33, 'Operator C');`

---

## **5. Writing a Function with a FOR Loop**

- You can loop through table rows using `FOR record_variable IN SELECT...`
    
- Store the row in a **record variable** and use it inside the loop.
    

### **Example Function:**
	
	sql
	
`CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION phone.get_phones() RETURNS VOID AS $$ DECLARE   rec RECORD; BEGIN   FOR rec IN SELECT number, operator FROM phone.phones LOOP     RAISE NOTICE 'Number: %, Operator: %', rec.number, rec.operator;   END LOOP; END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;`

- This function loops through all rows in the `phones` table and prints each row's details.

## **6. Loop Without a Function â€“ Top 10 Longest Movies Example**

- PostgreSQL's `DO` block can be used without a full function:
	    
		
		sql
		
`DO $$ DECLARE   rec RECORD; BEGIN   FOR rec IN     SELECT title, length FROM film     ORDER BY length DESC     LIMIT 10   LOOP     RAISE NOTICE 'Title: %, Duration: % min', rec.title, rec.length;   END LOOP; END; $$;`

- Displays the 10 longest movies in the `film` table (from a typical DVD rental database).
    

---

## **7. Converting the Query into a Reusable Function**

- You can wrap the above query into a reusable function:
	    
		sql
		
`CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_long_movies() RETURNS VOID AS $$ DECLARE   rec RECORD; BEGIN   FOR rec IN     SELECT title, length FROM film     ORDER BY length DESC     LIMIT 20   LOOP     RAISE NOTICE 'Title: %, Duration: % min', rec.title, rec.length;   END LOOP; END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;`

---

## **8. Tips and Reminders**

- Use **comments** (`--`) in your functions for clarity, especially in longer code blocks.
    
- Functions should match their schema: `schema_name.function_name`.
    
- Always **end** loops and functions properly using `END LOOP;`, `END;`, and appropriate semicolons.
    

---

## **9. Conclusion**

- The `FOR` loop is a **powerful control structure** in PostgreSQL, allowing iteration over numbers or rows.
    
- Use it to process data row by row, generate dynamic outputs, or automate tasks within functions.
    
- These loops are **efficient** and compatible with virtually all programming concepts.
    
- Practice by combining schema creation, table management, and looping functions to reinforce the concept.

## **Next Steps**

- Learn about `RAISE NOTICE` for debugging and feedback.
    
- Practice writing loops with more complex logic (e.g., conditional branching).
    
- Review your previous classes on schemas and functions to strengthen your foundation.
