# **Study Notes: Using `RAISE` and `VOID` in PostgreSQL Functions**

## **1. Introduction to `RAISE`**

- `RAISE` is used in PostgreSQL to **generate messages or warnings** within a function.
    
- It helps provide feedback during function execution, especially for **debugging or logging** purposes.
    

### **Types of RAISE Levels:**

1. **DEBUG** â€“ For low-level system information.
    
2. **LOG** â€“ To log important events.
    
3. **INFO** â€“ For informational messages.
    
4. **NOTICE** â€“ Mild warnings that donâ€™t require immediate action.
    
5. **WARNING** â€“ More serious than notice; something may be wrong.
    
6. **EXCEPTION** â€“ Critical; interrupts execution and stops the function.
    

> ðŸ”¸ **EXCEPTION** is the highest severity â€“ it stops function execution immediately when triggered.

## **2. Syntax of RAISE**
	
	sql
	
`RAISE level 'message %', value;`

- The `%` is a placeholder for dynamic values (e.g., a timestamp or variable).
    
- These values can be functions like `NOW()` to display current date/time.
    

### **Example:**
	
	sql
	
`RAISE INFO 'Process started at %', now();`

- This would output:  
    `INFO: Process started at 2025-06-02 10:15:30`
    

---

## **3. Practical Example Without a Function**

- You can use `RAISE` even outside of functions for practice.
    
- Using different levels (`INFO`, `NOTICE`, etc.), you can test the output and see how the message changes.

## **4. Creating a Table**

A simple table example was created in a schema:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE my_schema.comments (   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,   comment TEXT,   last_modified TIMESTAMP );`

- `last_modified` can be updated using `NOW()` to track the time of updates.
    

---

## **5. VOID Functions**

- A function declared as `RETURNS VOID` **does not return any value**.
    
- Useful when you just want the function to perform an action (like logging) without needing output.
    

### **Example of a VOID Function:**
	
	sql
	
`CREATE FUNCTION my_schema.void_function() RETURNS VOID AS $$ BEGIN   RAISE INFO 'Function called at %', now(); END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;`

- Calling this function wonâ€™t show anything unless a message is explicitly raised.
    

---

## **6. Using `RAISE NOTICE` in Functions**

- You can create a function that uses `RAISE NOTICE` to confirm that an action was completed.
    

### **Example:**
	
	sql
	
`CREATE FUNCTION my_schema.notice_function(id INT) RETURNS VOID AS $$ BEGIN   RAISE NOTICE 'Updating record with ID = %', id;   -- Update logic here END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;`

- This will output something like:  
    `NOTICE: Updating record with ID = 1`

## **7. Summary: When to Use What**

|Level|Purpose|Execution Effect|
|---|---|---|
|DEBUG/LOG|Background/system-level info|No interruption|
|INFO|General updates|No interruption|
|NOTICE|Informative notices|No interruption|
|WARNING|Possible issues|No interruption|
|EXCEPTION|Critical errors|Stops execution|
|VOID|No return from a function|Silent unless RAISE used|

---

## **Key Takeaways**

- Use `RAISE` to communicate what's happening inside your functions.
    
- Choose the correct severity level based on the message importance.
    
- `VOID` functions are silent by default but can still show messages if `RAISE` is used.
    
- `RAISE NOTICE` is ideal when you want to inform users without halting execution.
