## üìò **Study Notes: Introduction to Aggregate Functions in PostgreSQL**

### üß† **What Are Aggregate Functions?**

Aggregate functions perform **calculations on a set of rows** and return a **single result**. They are particularly useful for summarizing data in SQL databases.

### üî¢ **Main Aggregate Functions:**

| Function  | Description                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `AVG()`   | Calculates the **average** of a numeric column.      |
| `SUM()`   | Calculates the **total sum** of values in a column.  |
| `COUNT()` | Returns the **number of rows** (records) in a table. |
| `MAX()`   | Returns the **maximum value** from a column.         |
| `MIN()`   | Returns the **minimum value** from a column.         |

### üìä **Example Use Cases from the DVD Database:**

1. **Average Replacement Cost:**
    
    - Using `AVG()` to find the **average cost** of replacing a movie (e.g. DVD rental days).
        
    - Example:
        
			sql
        
        `SELECT ROUND(AVG(replacement_cost), 2) FROM film;`
        
    - Result: An average cost like **19.98**.
        
2. **Total Number of Films:**
    
    - Using `COUNT(*)` to count all movies.
        
    - Example:
        
			sql
        
        `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM film;`
        
    - Result: **1000** films.
        
3. **Counting Films in a Specific Category:**
    
    - Using `COUNT()` with `INNER JOIN` to filter by category (e.g., Drama).
        
    - Example:
        
			sql
        
        `SELECT COUNT(*)  FROM film  INNER JOIN film_category ON film.film_id = film_category.film_id  WHERE category_id = 7;`
        
    - Result: **62 drama films**.
        
4. **Finding the Most and Least Expensive Replacement Costs:**
    
    - Max cost:
        
			sql
        
        `SELECT MAX(replacement_cost) FROM film;`
        
        Result: **29.99**
        
    - Min cost:
        
			sql
        
        `SELECT MIN(replacement_cost) FROM film;`
        
        Result: **9.99**
        
5. **Summing Total Movie Durations:**
    
    - Example:
        
			sql
        
        `SELECT rating, SUM(length)  FROM film  GROUP BY rating;`
        
    - Returns total duration of films per **rating** (e.g. G, PG, PG-13).

### üìö **Important Clauses with Aggregate Functions:**

- **`GROUP BY`**: Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.
    
    - Example:
        
			sql
        
        `SELECT rating, AVG(length) FROM film GROUP BY rating;`
        
- **`HAVING`**: Filters groups after aggregation (used like `WHERE` but for grouped results).
    
    - Example (to be introduced in more advanced lessons).

### üîç **Other Notes:**

- Aggregate functions can also work with **JSON, XML**, and **Boolean** data (less commonly used).
    
- Always refer to PostgreSQL‚Äôs **official documentation** for a deeper understanding and more options.

### üìù **Next Steps in Learning:**

- Dive deeper into:
    
    - `GROUP BY`
        
    - `HAVING`
        
    - Joining tables for category-based aggregation
        
- Explore advanced clauses like:
    
    - `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, etc.
