# 📘 Study Notes: Understanding the `AVG()` Function in PostgreSQL

---

## 👋 Introduction

Welcome, students! Today’s class focuses on one of the most **frequently used functions** in PostgreSQL: the `AVG()` function. Let’s explore how to calculate average values using different SQL techniques and improve our database querying skills!

---

## 📊 What is `AVG()`?

The `AVG()` function calculates the **average (mean)** of a set of values from a specific column.

### 🔍 Basic Syntax
	
	sql
	
`SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM table_name;`

### 💡 Example:

Calculate the average payment from the `payment` table:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT AVG(amount) FROM payment; -- Output: 4.2`

This tells us that, on average, customers paid **$4.20 per film**. 🎬💰

---

## 🎯 Improving Readability

Sometimes, raw numbers can have too many decimal places. Use the `NUMERIC` type to format the result:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT AVG(amount)::NUMERIC(10, 2) FROM payment; -- Output: 4.20`

✅ **NUMERIC(10, 2)** means up to 10 digits total, with 2 digits after the decimal point (cents).

---

## 🧩 Using `DISTINCT` with `AVG()`

You can combine `DISTINCT` with `AVG()` to **only consider unique values**, avoiding repetitions.

### Example:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT AVG(DISTINCT amount) FROM payment;`

This gives a higher average because duplicates are excluded. 🤓  
💬 Insight: **Cheaper films are likely rented more often**, hence more repetition in the raw dataset.

---

## ➕ Combining `SUM()` and `AVG()`

To get both total and average payments:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT    SUM(amount)::NUMERIC(10,2),    AVG(amount)::NUMERIC(10,2)  FROM payment;`

- 🧾 **Total Payments**: $661,000.04
    
- 📈 **Average per Transaction**: $4.20

## 🧱 Grouping Data: `GROUP BY`

Group data to get averages **per customer**:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT    c.customer_id,    c.first_name,    c.last_name,    AVG(p.amount)::NUMERIC(10,2) AS avg_payment FROM    payment p INNER JOIN    customer c ON p.customer_id = c.customer_id GROUP BY    c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name ORDER BY    c.customer_id;`

📊 This query gives each customer’s **average spending**. Helpful to understand customer behavior!

---

## 🔎 Filtering Groups: `HAVING`

Want to know which customers spend more than **$5 on average**?
	
	sql
	
`... -- same SELECT and JOIN as above HAVING AVG(p.amount) > 5;`

This filters out only the **high spenders** 🤑 — ideal for targeting VIP customers with promotions or marketing emails. 🎁📧

## ⚠️ Handling `NULL` Values with `AVG()`

What happens if some rows have no value?

### Sample table:

|id|amount|
|---|---|
|1|10|
|2|_NULL_|
|3|30|
	
	sql
	
`SELECT AVG(amount) FROM dummy_table; -- Output: 20.0`

🧠 **Explanation**:

- `NULL` is **ignored** by `AVG()`
    
- Total = 10 + 30 = 40 → Average = 40 / 2 = **20**
    
- If the NULL was a `0`, the result would be different: Average = (10 + 0 + 30) / 3 = **13.33**

## ✅ Summary

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|`AVG()`|Calculates average of values|
|`NUMERIC(10,2)`|Formats result to 2 decimal places|
|`DISTINCT` + `AVG()`|Calculates average of unique values only|
|`SUM()` + `AVG()`|Useful to get total and average in one query|
|`GROUP BY`|Gets average grouped by category (e.g., per customer)|
|`HAVING`|Filters groups by condition (e.g., avg > $5)|
|`NULL` Handling in `AVG()`|NULLs are ignored in calculations|

## 🏁 Conclusion

The `AVG()` function is extremely versatile in PostgreSQL. Whether you're working with raw data, formatting results, combining with other functions, or filtering for business insights — it's a critical tool for data analysis. 🔧📈
