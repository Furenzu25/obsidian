# 📘 Study Notes: Using the `SUM()` Function in PostgreSQL

---

## 👋 Welcome Back!

Hello students!  
In this lesson, we explored the **`SUM()`** function — a key SQL tool used to **calculate the total** of numeric values from a column.

---

## ➕ What is `SUM()`?

The `SUM()` function is used to:

- **Add up numeric values** (e.g., money, durations, quantities).
    
- Automatically **ignore `NULL` values** by default.
    

---

## 🔁 Handling Duplicates with `DISTINCT`

You can combine `SUM()` with `DISTINCT`:

- `SUM(column)` – Sums **all non-NULL** values, including duplicates.
    
- `SUM(DISTINCT column)` – Sums **only unique, non-NULL** values.
    

### 🧮 Example:

Values: `1, 1, 8, 2`

- Without `DISTINCT`: `1 + 1 + 8 + 2 = 12`
    
- With `DISTINCT`: `1 + 8 + 2 = 11`

## 🧪 Real Examples from the `payment` Table

### 💵 Example 1: Total Amount Paid by a Customer
	
	sql
	
`SELECT SUM(amount) FROM payment WHERE customer_id = 2000;`

- If `customer_id = 2000` does **not exist**, it returns **no rows** (not even zero).
    

---

### 🧯 Handling Missing Values with `COALESCE`

To return zero instead of `NULL`, use `COALESCE`:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT COALESCE(SUM(amount), 0) FROM payment WHERE customer_id = 2000;`

📌 Ensures a result is always shown, even when no data exists.

---

## 👥 Grouping and Summing

You can use `GROUP BY` to **calculate totals per category**, such as by customer:

### 🧾 Example 2: Total Spent Per Customer
	
	sql
	
`SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total FROM payment GROUP BY customer_id ORDER BY total;`

📊 Result:

- Customer ID `318` spent the **least** → `$27`
    
- Customer ID `484` spent the **most** → `$211`
    

💡 Useful for identifying top spenders and possibly giving them rewards or discounts.

---

## 🎯 Filtering Group Totals with `HAVING`

Use `HAVING` to filter grouped totals, such as customers who spent more than $200:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total FROM payment GROUP BY customer_id HAVING SUM(amount) > 200;`

🎉 This will show customers who are heavy spenders.

---

## 🎬 Example: Total Rental Days

Switching to the `rental` table, you can use `SUM()` to analyze how long rentals lasted.

### 📆 Example 3: Total Rental Days
	
	sql
	
`SELECT SUM(rental_date) FROM rental;`

This example should instead subtract **return date from rental date** to find **duration**, then sum:

### 🔄 Example 4: Total Rental Duration
	
	sql
	
`SELECT customer.first_name, customer.last_name,        SUM(return_date - rental_date) AS total_days FROM rental INNER JOIN customer ON rental.customer_id = customer.customer_id GROUP BY customer.customer_id ORDER BY total_days DESC;`

📌 This shows:

- Total days each customer kept rentals.
    
- Customer loyalty in terms of **time**, not just money.
    

🧠 Important:

- High rental days ≠ high spending (someone may rent often but choose cheap movies).
    
- Use in combination with financial data for a full customer profile.

## 🧾 Summary Table

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|`SUM(column)`|Total of all non-NULL values|
|`SUM(DISTINCT column)`|Total of unique, non-NULL values|
|`COALESCE(SUM(...), 0)`|Replaces `NULL` totals with zero|
|`GROUP BY` + `SUM()`|Sums grouped by a specific column (e.g., ID)|
|`HAVING`|Filters groups based on aggregate result|
|`SUM(return - rental)`|Total duration of rentals per customer|

## 💬 Final Thoughts

The `SUM()` function is:

- 🧩 Simple, yet powerful.
    
- 💼 Commonly used in reports, dashboards, and business insights.
    
- 🛠️ Often combined with `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `COALESCE` for richer analysis.
