# 🧠 Study Notes: Introduction to **Window Functions** in SQL (PostgreSQL)

## 👋 Welcome!

Hello to all students! In today’s class, we’re diving into a powerful SQL concept: **Window Functions**. This is an important topic that extends the capabilities of SQL beyond basic aggregate functions.

---

## 🪟 What is a Window Function?

A **Window Function** performs a calculation **across a set of rows that are related to the current row**, without collapsing them into a single result.

### 🆚 Window vs Aggregate Functions

|Feature|Aggregate Function|Window Function|
|---|---|---|
|Output|One row per group|One row per input row|
|Groups Rows|✅ Yes|❌ No|
|Maintains Row Identity|❌ No|✅ Yes|

- Aggregate Example: `SUM(price)` gives **one total** for a group.
    
- Window Example: `SUM(price) OVER (PARTITION BY category)` gives a **total per row**, still showing individual rows.

## 🧩 How It Works

A **Window Function** requires the use of the **`OVER` clause**, which defines how rows are grouped and ordered for calculations.
	
	sql
	
`SELECT      product_name,      price,     AVG(price) OVER (PARTITION BY group_name) AS avg_price FROM products;`

### 🔑 Important Clauses in Window Functions:

- `OVER`: Required for all window functions.
    
- `PARTITION BY`: Groups rows into partitions (like a `GROUP BY` within the function).
    
- `ORDER BY`: Orders rows within each partition.
    

> 📝 _If `PARTITION BY` is omitted, the function treats the entire dataset as one group._

## 🔁 Review: Aggregate Functions

Before jumping fully into Window Functions, we reviewed **Aggregate Functions**:

### Example:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT AVG(price) FROM products;`

This gives **one average** for all products.

We also used `GROUP BY` to get an average per category:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT      group_name,      AVG(price)  FROM products INNER JOIN product_groups ON products.group_id = product_groups.group_id GROUP BY group_name;`

---

## 🛠️ Example Tables Created

To demonstrate these concepts, we built two simple tables:

1. **product_groups**
    
    - `group_id`
        
    - `group_name`
        
2. **products**
    
    - `product_id`
        
    - `product_name`
        
    - `price`
        
    - `group_id` (foreign key)
        

We inserted example rows like smartphones, tablets, and laptops with different prices.

---

## 📊 Applying Window Functions

Let’s say we want to calculate **average price per group** but still keep **all product rows** visible.
	
	sql
	
`SELECT      product_name,     price,     group_name,     AVG(price) OVER (PARTITION BY group_name) AS avg_group_price FROM products INNER JOIN product_groups ON products.group_id = product_groups.group_id;`

This shows:

- Each individual product with its own price ✅
    
- The average price for the product’s group alongside it ✅
    

> 📌 This **does not reduce** the number of rows in the result like aggregate functions do!

## 🔍 Syntax Overview
	
	sql
	
`<function>(<arguments>) OVER (     [PARTITION BY clause]     [ORDER BY clause] )`

- `PARTITION BY` → Optional; splits result into smaller windows.
    
- `ORDER BY` → Optional; defines the row order within each partition.
    
- Default behavior places `NULL` values **last** unless overridden.

## 🧪 What’s Next?

In upcoming classes, we'll explore **different types of window functions**, such as:

- `RANK()` 📈
    
- `PERCENT_RANK()` 📊
    
- `FIRST_VALUE()` and `LAST_VALUE()` ⏪⏩
    
- Other statistical and ranking functions
    

All examples will continue to use the **products table**, so be sure to keep that structure ready for hands-on practice.

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

- Window Functions = Aggregate-like functions that **don’t collapse** rows.
    
- Always use `OVER` clause with Window Functions.
    
- Use `PARTITION BY` to segment data and `ORDER BY` to define row order.
    
- Useful for ranking, running totals, group averages **with full data visibility**.

That’s it for today’s lesson! 🎓  
Hope you found it helpful and exciting to discover how Window Functions allow **powerful insights** without losing **individual row visibility**.
