# 🧠 **Study Notes: Window Functions in PostgreSQL – RANK() Function**

## 👋 Introduction

Welcome, students! Today’s lesson builds on our understanding of **Window Functions** in PostgreSQL, specifically focusing on the **`RANK()`** function.

---

## 🔍 What is the `RANK()` Function?

- The `RANK()` function assigns a **rank** to each row within a **partition** of a result set.
    
- It is a **window function**, which means:
    
    - It operates on a subset (or "window") of rows without collapsing them into a single row.
        
    - The keyword `OVER` is mandatory to indicate it's a window function.
        

### ⚙️ How it Works:

- **Rows with the same value** get the **same rank**.
    
- The **next rank number is skipped** depending on how many rows shared the previous rank.
    

📌 For example:

|Value|Rank|
|---|---|
|A|1|
|A|1|
|B|3|
|B|3|
|B|3|
|C|6|

This jump (1 ➡️ 3 ➡️ 6) is due to ties.

## 🧪 Basic Syntax
	
	sql
	
`SELECT column_name,        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY col_name ORDER BY col_name) AS rank FROM table_name;`

### 🔑 Components:

- `RANK()`: The ranking function.
    
- `OVER`: Required for all window functions.
    
- `PARTITION BY`: _(optional)_ Divides the result set into groups.
    
- `ORDER BY`: Specifies row order within each partition.

## 🛠️ Practical Example: Ranking Letters

We created a simple `rankings` table with column `c` containing letters like A, B, C, E.

Then, we ran:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT c,        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY c) AS rank FROM rankings;`

### 🔍 Output:

- Rows with the same letter (like A, B) received the same rank.
    
- The next rank jumps accordingly, demonstrating how `RANK()` handles ties.

## 💼 Real-World Application: Ranking Products by Price

Let’s apply this to our `products` table, which includes:

- `product_id`
    
- `product_name`
    
- `price`
    
- `group_id`
    

We aim to **rank products by their price**.

### 📊 Step 1: Overall Price Ranking (No Partition)
	
	sql
	
`SELECT product_id,        name,        price,        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY price DESC) AS price_rank FROM products;`

📈 This ranks all products from most expensive to cheapest.

🧠 _Important Insight_:

- Products with equal prices share the same rank.
    
- Next rank skips ahead based on how many tied.

## 🗂️ Step 2: Ranking Within Each Product Group

Let’s refine our ranking **within each category** (e.g., Smartphones, Tablets, Laptops).

### ✍️ SQL Example:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT p.product_id,        p.name,        p.price,        pg.group_name,        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY pg.group_name ORDER BY p.price DESC) AS group_price_rank FROM products p INNER JOIN product_groups pg ON p.group_id = pg.group_id;`

📌 **What’s happening here?**

- We use `INNER JOIN` to connect products to their groups.
    
- `PARTITION BY` ensures products are ranked **within each group** (smartphones, tablets, etc.).
    
- `ORDER BY price DESC` sorts from most to least expensive within each group.
    

### 🎯 Result:

- Products ranked #1, #2, etc., inside each category.
    
- Ties handled similarly – same rank, with skipped positions.

## 🧩 Summary of Key Concepts

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|`RANK()`|Assigns rank with gaps in case of ties|
|`OVER`|Required for all window functions|
|`PARTITION BY`|(Optional) Splits result into groups (e.g., by product group)|
|`ORDER BY`|Sorts rows within each partition|
|`INNER JOIN`|Connects products to their group names for organized categorization|

## 💡 Use Cases for `RANK()`

- 📊 Leaderboards
    
- 🛍️ Product rankings
    
- 📈 Sales performance reports
    
- 🧮 Grading systems

## 📌 Final Thoughts

- 🧪 We practiced using `RANK()` on both simple and joined tables.
    
- 🧠 Remember: `RANK()` creates **ordered classifications** that respect **ties**.
    
- ❓ For any confusion, refer to the **official documentation** or post in the **course forum**.
