# 🧠 Study Notes: Window Functions – `DENSE_RANK()` in SQL

## 👋 Introduction

Hello, students!  
Welcome to another lesson in our SQL journey. Today, we're diving into the **`DENSE_RANK()`** function — a variation of the `RANK()` function we studied earlier.

Let’s break it down! 🔍

---

## 📌 What is `DENSE_RANK()`?

- `DENSE_RANK()` assigns a **ranking** to rows **within a partition** based on a specified order.
    
- Unlike `RANK()`, **there are no gaps** in the ranking sequence, even when there are **ties** (equal values).
    
- It’s a **window function**, just like `RANK()`.
    

### 🆚 `RANK()` vs. `DENSE_RANK()`

|Feature|`RANK()`|`DENSE_RANK()`|
|---|---|---|
|Handles ties|Yes|Yes|
|Skips next ranks|✅ Yes (creates gaps)|❌ No (no gaps in ranking)|
|Example with 3 ties|1, 1, 1, 4, 5|1, 1, 1, 2, 3|

## 🧪 Basic Syntax
	
	sql
	
`SELECT column_name,        DENSE_RANK() OVER (            PARTITION BY column_name -- optional            ORDER BY column_name ASC|DESC        ) AS dense_rank FROM table_name;`

### 📘 Components:

- `DENSE_RANK()`: The function itself.
    
- `OVER`: Required for all window functions.
    
- `PARTITION BY`: _(Optional)_ Divides data into groups.
    
- `ORDER BY`: Specifies how rows are sorted within each partition.

## ✍️ Example 1: Ranking Letters

We created a table and inserted letters like A, B, C, D.

After running:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT letter,        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY letter) AS dense_rank FROM dense_rank_table;`

### 🔍 Result:

- Rows with the same letter received the same rank.
    
- The next rank was **not skipped**, unlike with `RANK()`.

## 💼 Example 2: Product Price Ranking

Let’s use the `products` table from previous lessons, which contains:

- 📱 Smartphones
    
- 💻 Laptops
    
- 📟 Tablets
    

We want to **rank them by price**, from highest to lowest.

### ✅ Without Partition (All Products Together)
	
	sql
	
`SELECT product_id,        name,        price,        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY price DESC) AS price_rank FROM products;`

🧠 _Insight_:

- All products are treated as part of a single group.
    
- Equal prices = same rank.
    
- No rank values skipped.

## 🗂️ Example 3: Ranking Within Product Categories

Now let’s **rank each product within its own category** using `PARTITION BY`.
	
	sql
	
`SELECT p.product_id,        p.name,        p.price,        pg.group_name,        DENSE_RANK() OVER (            PARTITION BY pg.group_name            ORDER BY p.price DESC        ) AS group_price_rank FROM products p JOIN product_groups pg ON p.group_id = pg.group_id;`

### 🎯 Result:

- Products are **grouped by category** (e.g., smartphone, tablet, laptop).
    
- Rankings are **independent within each category**.
    
- Equal prices in a category get the same rank.
    
- Ranks are **consecutive** (1, 2, 2, 3, not 1, 2, 2, 4).

## 🔁 ASC vs DESC Order

You can change the ranking direction:

- `ORDER BY price DESC`: From most expensive to cheapest 💰
    
- `ORDER BY price ASC`: From cheapest to most expensive 💸
    

Just adjust the `ORDER BY` clause accordingly.

## 🧩 Key Takeaways

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|`DENSE_RANK()`|Ranks rows without skipping numbers after ties|
|`PARTITION BY`|Organizes rows into groups for separate rankings|
|`ORDER BY`|Defines sorting order within each group|
|No Skipped Ranks|Ranking is always continuous: 1, 2, 2, 3, not 1, 2, 2, 4|
|Use Cases|Leaderboards, product pricing, grading systems, sales ranks|

---

## 🙌 Final Thoughts

- The key difference between `RANK()` and `DENSE_RANK()` is **whether ranks skip numbers after ties**.
    
- Use `DENSE_RANK()` when you want **sequential rankings without gaps**.
    
- It’s simple, powerful, and great for clean, ordered results in grouped data.
