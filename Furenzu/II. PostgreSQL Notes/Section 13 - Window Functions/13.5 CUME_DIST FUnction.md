# 📘 Study Notes: Understanding `CUME_DIST()` in SQL

## 👋 Hello All Students!

Welcome to another session! In this class, we’re exploring a very useful window function in PostgreSQL — **`CUME_DIST()`**, short for _Cumulative Distribution_. Let’s break it down.

---

## 📊 What is `CUME_DIST()`?

`CUME_DIST()` returns the **cumulative distribution** of a value in a result set — in simpler terms, it shows the **relative standing or rank** of a value in a dataset **as a percentage**.

> 🧠 Use Case Example:  
> _“What percentage of products had total sales less than or equal to this one?”_

---

## 🔧 Syntax Overview
	
	sql
	
`SELECT column_name,        CUME_DIST() OVER (            [PARTITION BY column]            ORDER BY column        ) AS cumulative_percentage FROM table_name;`

### 🧩 Components:

- **`PARTITION BY`** _(optional)_: Divides the dataset into separate groups (e.g., by year).
    
- **`ORDER BY`** _(required)_: Sorts rows within each partition to calculate distribution.
    

---

## 📐 How It Works

- Returns a **decimal between 0 and 1**.
    
- **Higher values** mean the data point ranks higher in its group.
    
- **Ties** (equal values) receive the same cumulative percentage.

## 🧪 Real-World Example: Sales Statistics Table

Let’s imagine we create a table called `sales_statistics`:

|seller_name|year|total_sales|
|---|---|---|
|John|2018|120000|
|Mary|2018|150000|
|Alex|2018|90000|
|Sarah|2018|110000|

> 🔢 Now, if we apply `CUME_DIST()` ordered by `total_sales`, it would show what **percentage of sellers** had sales **less than or equal to each person**.

### Example Output (2018):

|seller_name|total_sales|cume_dist|
|---|---|---|
|Alex|90000|0.25|
|Sarah|110000|0.50|
|John|120000|0.75|
|Mary|150000|1.00|

📌 Interpretation:

- Mary sold more than or equal to **100%** of sellers.
    
- John sold more than or equal to **75%** of sellers.
    
- Alex sold more than or equal to **25%** of sellers.

## 📅 Partitioning by Year

You can use `PARTITION BY year` to calculate cumulative percentages **within each year**:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT seller_name,        year,        total_sales,        CUME_DIST() OVER (            PARTITION BY year            ORDER BY total_sales        ) AS sales_percentile FROM sales_statistics;`

🎯 _This will give you a separate cumulative percentage for 2018 and 2019, treating them as independent groups._

## 📌 Practical Insights

- Want to find **top-performing sellers**? Use `CUME_DIST()` to identify the **top 10% or 1%**.
    
- Helps you visualize **sales distribution** and understand the **spread of performance**.
    
- Very useful in **reporting dashboards**, **rankings**, and **data analysis**.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

|Feature|Behavior|
|---|---|
|What it returns|Decimal value between 0 and 1|
|Tie handling|Equal values share the same percentile|
|Requires `ORDER BY`|✅ Yes|
|Optional `PARTITION`|✅ Yes (useful for groups like years, departments, etc.)|
|Great for|Percentile ranks, data distribution, performance comparison|

## ✅ Final Notes

- This function is ideal when you want **relative percentages**, not just rankings.
    
- You now know how to analyze data using **cumulative distribution** for **better decision making**.
