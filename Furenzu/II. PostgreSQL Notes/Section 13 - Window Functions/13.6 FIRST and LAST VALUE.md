# üìò Study Notes: `FIRST_VALUE()` and `LAST_VALUE()` in SQL

## üëã Hello to All Students!

In this class, we‚Äôll cover two very useful window functions in SQL:  
**`FIRST_VALUE()`** and **`LAST_VALUE()`**.  
Both are similar in structure but serve **opposite purposes**.

---

## üß† What Do These Functions Do?

- **`FIRST_VALUE()`** returns the **first value** in a result set or partition.
    
- **`LAST_VALUE()`** returns the **last value** in a result set or partition.
    

> ‚úÖ These are great when you want to track the first or last item in sorted groups ‚Äî like the **cheapest** or **most expensive** product in a category.

---

## üß™ Syntax Overview
	
	sql
	
`FIRST_VALUE(column_or_expression) OVER (   [PARTITION BY column]   ORDER BY column ASC|DESC   [ROWS BETWEEN ...] )  LAST_VALUE(column_or_expression) OVER (   [PARTITION BY column]   ORDER BY column ASC|DESC   [ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING] )`

### üß© Explanation:

- **Expression**: Can be a column or any scalar expression (NOT another window function).
    
- **`PARTITION BY`** _(optional)_: Divides data into groups (e.g., by category).
    
- **`ORDER BY`**: Defines the sorting order (ASC/DESC).
    
- **`ROWS` or `RANGE`**: Controls how the function looks at rows in the partition (used mainly with `LAST_VALUE()`).

## üìä Example 1: Using `FIRST_VALUE()` on Products Table

Let‚Äôs say we have a `products` table:

|id|product_name|group|price|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Kindle|Tablet|150|
|2|iPhone|Smartphone|900|
|3|HP EliteBook|Notebook|1200|
|4|Moto G10 Power|Smartphone|200|

### üéØ Goal:

Get the **first product (lowest price)** overall.
	
	sql
	
`SELECT product_name,        price,        FIRST_VALUE(product_name) OVER (ORDER BY price) AS lowest_priced_product FROM products;`

üìå Output: Every row will show **‚ÄúKindle‚Äù** in `lowest_priced_product` because it's the cheapest.

---

## üìä Example 2: Using `LAST_VALUE()` ‚Äî Getting the Most Expensive

To get the **last value** (i.e., most expensive), we must use a frame clause to ensure proper behavior.
	
	sql
	
`SELECT product_name,        price,        LAST_VALUE(product_name) OVER (          ORDER BY price          RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING        ) AS highest_priced_product FROM products;`

üßæ Output: Every row will show **‚ÄúHP EliteBook‚Äù**, the most expensive item.

> üí° Without the `RANGE` or `ROWS` clause, `LAST_VALUE()` might only look at the current row's window instead of the full partition.

---

## üì¶ Example 3: Using `PARTITION BY` ‚Äî Grouped Results

Let‚Äôs group products by their `group` (e.g., Smartphone, Tablet, Notebook) and get **first and last** values per group.
	
	sql
	
`SELECT product_name,        group,        price,        FIRST_VALUE(product_name) OVER (          PARTITION BY group          ORDER BY price        ) AS cheapest_in_group,        LAST_VALUE(product_name) OVER (          PARTITION BY group          ORDER BY price          RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING        ) AS most_expensive_in_group FROM products;`

üéØ Result:

- For `Smartphone`, you might get:
    
    - **Cheapest**: Moto G10 Power
        
    - **Most Expensive**: iPhone
        
- For `Tablet`: Kindle Fire as cheapest
    
- For `Notebook`: HP EliteBook as most expensive

## üß† Key Takeaways

|Function|Purpose|Requires Frame?|
|---|---|---|
|`FIRST_VALUE()`|Gets the first (lowest/earliest) value|‚ùå Not required|
|`LAST_VALUE()`|Gets the last (highest/latest) value|‚úÖ Yes (use `RANGE` or `ROWS`)|

---

## üõ† Practical Tip

- Always **use `ORDER BY`** to define what "first" and "last" mean.
    
- For `LAST_VALUE()`, **always use the frame**:
	    
		sql
	    
    `RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING`
    
- You can also use `ROWS` instead of `RANGE`, depending on the need.

## üßæ Final Notes

These two functions are extremely useful when you need to:

- Compare items across partitions (e.g., by category or date).
    
- Get insights like **"first sale of the month"** or **"last item purchased"**.
