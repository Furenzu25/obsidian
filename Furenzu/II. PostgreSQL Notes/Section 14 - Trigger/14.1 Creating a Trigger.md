# üß† Study Notes: Introduction to **Triggers** in SQL

---

## üëã Welcome Students!

In today‚Äôs class, we explored **Triggers** in SQL ‚Äî a powerful way to automatically respond to changes in your database. Let‚Äôs break it down step-by-step so you can understand how to use them effectively.

---

## üìå What is a Trigger?

A **trigger** is a database mechanism that _automatically executes_ a specified function in response to certain events (e.g. `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`).

Think of it like an alert system üîî ‚Äî whenever something changes in the table, the trigger reacts!

## üõ†Ô∏è Trigger Structure Overview

To create a trigger, two main components are needed:

### 1. **Create a Function**

A function must be defined **before** the trigger.  
It must:

- Be written in **PL/pgSQL** (or another supported language)
    
- Use `RETURNS TRIGGER`
    
- Include logic inside a `BEGIN ... END;` block
    
- Be enclosed in `$$` (dollar quotes)
    

### 2. **Create the Trigger**

Once the function is ready, create a trigger that:

- Specifies **when** it should activate (`BEFORE` or `AFTER` an event)
    
- Indicates the **table** it applies to
    
- Uses either:
    
    - `FOR EACH ROW` (fires once per row affected)
        
    - `FOR EACH STATEMENT` (fires once per SQL statement)
        

Then link it to the function using `EXECUTE PROCEDURE`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è ROW vs STATEMENT Triggers

|Type|Behavior|
|---|---|
|`FOR EACH ROW`|Trigger fires once per row affected. Ideal for row-specific tracking.|
|`FOR EACH STATEMENT`|Trigger fires once per statement, regardless of how many rows are affected. Good for bulk actions.|

üìù _Example:_ Deleting 100 rows:

- `FOR EACH ROW`: Fires 100 times
    
- `FOR EACH STATEMENT`: Fires once

## üîß Practical Example: Audit Log for Employee Name Changes

### üìã Step-by-Step

#### 1. **Create Tables**
	
	sql
	
`-- Employees table CREATE TABLE employees (   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,   first_name TEXT,   last_name TEXT );  -- Audit table to track name changes CREATE TABLE employee_audit (   id INT,   old_last_name TEXT,   changed_at TIMESTAMP );`

#### 2. **Create the Function**
	
	sql
	
`CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_last_name_changes() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$ BEGIN   IF NEW.last_name <> OLD.last_name THEN     INSERT INTO employee_audit (id, old_last_name, changed_at)     VALUES (OLD.id, OLD.last_name, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);   END IF;   RETURN NEW; END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;`

#### 3. **Create the Trigger**
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TRIGGER last_name_changes BEFORE UPDATE ON employees FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE log_last_name_changes();`

---

## üß™ Testing the Trigger

### ‚ûï Insert Sample Data:
	
	sql
	
`INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name) VALUES ('John', 'Doe'); INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name) VALUES ('Lily', 'Alves');`

### ‚úèÔ∏è Update a Last Name:
	
	sql
	
`UPDATE employees SET last_name = 'Silva' WHERE id = 2;`

### üîç Check the Audit Log:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM employee_audit;`

‚úÖ You should see a record of the change, showing:

- Employee ID
    
- Their old last name
    
- The exact timestamp of the change
    

---

## üìÇ Viewing Triggers in the Database

You can list all triggers for a table using:
	
	sql
	
`\dS employees`

This command displays all associated triggers for the `employees` table.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Always **create the function first**, then the **trigger**.
    
- Triggers automate reactions to `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` actions.
    
- Use `FOR EACH ROW` for detailed tracking and `FOR EACH STATEMENT` for broader changes.
    
- Trigger functions must return `TRIGGER`.
