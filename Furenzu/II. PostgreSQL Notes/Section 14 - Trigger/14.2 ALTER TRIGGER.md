# üìö **Study Notes: Modifying and Testing SQL Triggers**

## üëã Hello Students!

In this session, we‚Äôre diving deeper into **SQL triggers**, focusing on **how to modify triggers** and **implement validation logic**‚Äîespecially useful in real-world database management.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **How to Modify an Existing Trigger**

To rename or alter a trigger, use the `ALTER TRIGGER` command:
	
	sql
	
`ALTER TRIGGER old_trigger_name RENAME TO new_trigger_name;`

- This is helpful if you want to update the trigger‚Äôs name or reconfigure its setup without rewriting it from scratch.

## üß± **Creating a New Example from Scratch**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **New `employees` Table**

We begin by dropping any existing table and creating a new one with the following structure:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE employees (     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,     first_name TEXT,     last_name TEXT,     salary DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.00 );`

- `salary` is a **decimal** type and **cannot be null**, with a **default of 0**.
    

---

## üß† **Creating a Salary Validation Function**

We create a function to **validate salary increases**, preventing increases over **100%**.

### üîç Function Logic:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_salary() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$ BEGIN     IF (NEW.salary - OLD.salary) / OLD.salary >= 1 THEN         RAISE EXCEPTION 'Salary increase cannot be that high!';     END IF;     RETURN NEW; END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;`

### üîë Notes:

- The calculation checks if the **new salary** is more than **double** (100%) the old salary.
    
- If so, it **raises an exception** and **aborts the update**.
    

---

## üöÄ **Creating the Trigger**

We then bind our function to a trigger:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TRIGGER salary_before_update BEFORE UPDATE ON employees FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION check_salary();`

### ‚úÖ What This Does:

- Runs **before every update** on the `employees` table.
    
- Checks **every row individually** (`FOR EACH ROW`) to ensure changes comply with the salary rule.

## üîÑ **Testing the Trigger**

### Insert a sample record:
	
	sql
	
`INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, salary) VALUES ('John', 'Doe', 100000.00);`

### Attempt an invalid update:
	
	sql
	
`UPDATE employees SET salary = 210000.00 WHERE id = 1;`

### ‚ùå Result:

- You'll get an **error message**:
    
    > ‚ÄúSalary increase cannot be that high!‚Äù
    
- The update will be **blocked** and **not saved** to the database.
    

---

## ‚úèÔ∏è **Renaming the Trigger**

If you want to rename the trigger:
	
	sql
	
`ALTER TRIGGER salary_before_update ON employees RENAME TO salary_before_raise;`

---

## üîç **Listing Existing Triggers**

To see all triggers on a table:
	
	sql
	
`\dS employees`

- Shows all related triggers, like:
    
    > `salary_before_raise BEFORE UPDATE ON employees FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION check_salary();`
    

---

## üéì **Key Takeaways**

- Always create **functions first**, then **triggers**.
    
- Triggers can **prevent invalid operations** like unreasonable salary hikes.
    
- Use `FOR EACH ROW` to check changes line-by-line.
    
- Use `RAISE EXCEPTION` to show custom error messages.
    
- You can **rename triggers** without recreating them.
    
- Verify trigger existence with `\dS table_name`.

## ‚úÖ Next Steps

- Experiment with your own trigger logic ‚ú®
    
- Try modifying other columns with conditions
    
- Let‚Äôs keep learning!
