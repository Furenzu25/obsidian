# 🛡️ PostgreSQL Security Basics – Study Notes

## 👋 Introduction

Welcome to a new section focused on **PostgreSQL database security**. Security is **critical** in any system — not just as a one-time setup but as an **ongoing responsibility** for every database administrator.

> 💡 Security should be **proactive**, not reactive.

## 🔐 Why Database Security Matters

- Protects against **data theft** and **unauthorized access**.
    
- Frequently neglected by companies, leading to major breaches.
    
- DBAs must check:
    
    - 👤 Who can access what?
        
    - ⏳ For how long?
        
    - 🛑 What should be restricted?

## ✋ Temporarily Preventing User Login

Sometimes you want to prevent a user from logging in without deleting their account.

### ✅ How to do it:
	
	sql
	
`ALTER USER username NOLOGIN;`

- Example: `ALTER USER vitor NOLOGIN;`
    
- Use `\du` to verify: user should have `Cannot login` in their attributes.
    

> 🛡️ Good for compromised accounts or temporary suspensions.

## 🔁 Limiting Simultaneous Connections

You can also **restrict how many connections a user can make** at once.

### 🔢 Set connection limit:
	
	sql
	
`ALTER USER username CONNECTION LIMIT 10;`

- `0`: No connections allowed.
    
- `10`: Max of 10 simultaneous connections.
    
- `-1`: Unlimited connections (default).
    

> 📌 Use to control resource usage or avoid abuse.

## ⚡ Immediately Disconnect Users

If you revoke login rights, the user may still stay connected until they disconnect or the DB restarts.

### 🔨 Disconnect them now:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE usename = 'username';`

- Instantly kicks them out without rebooting the DB.

## 🧹 Safely Deleting Users Without Losing Data

You **cannot** delete a user if they still **own any database objects**.

### ❌ Wrong:
	
	sql
	
`DROP ROLE vitor; -- ❌ Will fail if user owns objects`

### ✅ Right process:

1. **Transfer ownership** of all objects:
    
	
	sql
	
`REASSIGN OWNED BY vitor TO postgres;`

2. **Revoke all privileges**:
    
	
	sql
	
`DROP OWNED BY vitor;`

3. **Delete the user**:
    
	
	sql
	
`DROP USER vitor;`

- Use `\du` to confirm user removal.
    
- Run `\l` or `\dt` to confirm **no data was lost**.
    

> ✅ Ensures database objects (tables, schemas, etc.) remain intact.
