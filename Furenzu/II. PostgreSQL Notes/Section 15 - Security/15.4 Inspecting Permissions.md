# 📘 Study Notes: Inspecting Database Permissions in PostgreSQL

## 👋 Introduction

Hello students, welcome to another insightful class! Today, we dive into the **inspection of permissions** in PostgreSQL — a crucial topic in **database security**. 🛡️

Knowing **who has access to what** is essential. This ensures that your data — the **heart of any business 💼** — is kept secure.

---

## 🕵️ What’s the Goal?

We want to:

- Inspect all **user permissions** in the database.
    
- Ensure **users only have access** to what they should.
    
- Use tools and techniques to simplify **permission audits**.

## 👤 User Setup Review

We'll continue using the same user we created in the last class:

> `Joe`

Make sure your tables are recreated if needed and that **Joe** has access to them:
	
	sql
	
`GRANT ALL ON your_table TO joe;`

## 🔍 How to Inspect Permissions

### 1. 🔢 Using PostgreSQL Built-in Commands

- Enable extended output:
    
	
	sql
	
	`\x`

- Inspect permissions on a table:
    
	sql
	
	`\z your_table_name`

You’ll see a list like:

- `r`: SELECT (read)
    
- `w`: UPDATE (write)
    
- `a`: INSERT (add)
    
- `d`: DELETE
    
- `D`: TRUNCATE
    
- `x`: REFERENCES
    
- `t`: TRIGGER
    

👀 Example:  
User `joe` may have `arwdDxt` — meaning full access.

---

## 📊 SQL-Based Permission View

To make things clearer:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM aclexplode(has_table_privilege('joe', 'your_table', 'SELECT'));`

You can also run:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM your_table_name;`

This helps list all **granted commands** — insert, update, delete, truncate, trigger, etc.

---

## 🧰 Optional Tool: `pg_permissions` (GitHub Utility)

If you want a **more elegant, user-friendly** permission view, try this:

### 🚀 Installation Steps (Linux)

1. **Switch to root**:
    
	
	bash
	
	`sudo su`

2. **Clone the repo**:
    
		bash
	
	`git clone https://github.com/michelp/pg_permissions.git`

3. **Install `make` (if not installed)**:
    
		bash
	
	`apt install make`

4. **Build the extension**:
    
	 bash
	 
	`cd pg_permissions make install`

---

### 🧩 Enable Extension in Postgres

Switch back to the Postgres user and connect to your DB:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE EXTENSION pg_permissions;`

Now list all permissions:
	
	sql
	
	`SELECT * FROM all_permissions;`

✔️ You now have a **complete permissions report** — objects, users, actions.

---

## 🔄 Modify Permissions via Views

Want to change permissions directly?

Use the **`UPDATE` command** on the extension views.

For example:
	
	sql
	
	`UPDATE all_permissions SET privileges = 'arwd' WHERE grantee = 'joe';`

This will update Joe's permission on that object — **easy, fast, and powerful**.

---

## ✅ Summary

- Always **inspect and audit permissions** 🔐.
    
- PostgreSQL offers built-in tools and views.
    
- `pg_permissions` provides a **clear, centralized permission report**.
    
- Managing security becomes easier with tools and organized structure.
