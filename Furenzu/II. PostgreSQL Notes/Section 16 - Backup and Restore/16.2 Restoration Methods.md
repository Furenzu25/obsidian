# 📦 PostgreSQL Backup Restoration – Study Notes

## 👋 Introduction

Hello, students! In this session, we dive into **restoration methods** in PostgreSQL. After learning how to back up databases, we now explore how to **restore those backups** — whether after a crash, server change, or migration.

## 🔁 Restoration Tools Overview

### 1. **`pg_restore`** – The Main Restoration Command

- Designed for restoring backups created by `pg_dump` (especially in **non-plain formats** like `.tar`, `.custom`, etc.).
    
- Syntax is very similar to `pg_dump`.
    
- Includes:
    
    - Optional configs: `-p` (port), `-U` (user), `-W` (password), etc.
        
    - Selective restoration options (restore just **privileges**, **functions**, **schemas**, etc.).
        
    - Use `--help` to see full syntax.
        

### 2. **`psql`** – Plain Text SQL File Restoration

- Ideal for backups in **plain `.sql` format**.
    
- Used to restore by executing SQL statements directly.
    
- Command example:
	
	bash
	
    `psql -U postgres -p 5432 -h localhost -d my_db_admin -f backup_file.sql`

## 🔧 How Restoration Works

### 📄 Plain SQL Restoration with `psql`

- Runs all SQL statements in the file: table creation, schema setup, user roles, permissions, etc.
    
- If the database already exists, you may see **errors** like "database already exists." Be cautious!
    
- Use `-f` for specifying file and `-1` for running everything in a single transaction.
    

### 💡 Tip:

To ignore errors and keep the restoration going:
	
	bash
	
	`psql ... -f file.sql --set ON_ERROR_STOP=off`

This prevents halting due to minor issues during execution.

## 🎯 Examples of Use Cases

### ➕ Full Database Restoration
	
	bash
	
	`pg_restore -U postgres -d my_db_name backup.tar`

### 📤 Create a Duplicate Database

- You can **clone** a backup to a new database:
	
	bash
	
    `createdb my_db_copy pg_restore -U postgres -d my_db_copy backup.tar`
    
- Useful for testing or comparing versions.

## 📋 Important Considerations

### ❗ Overwriting Risk

- Restoring to an **existing database** can overwrite structures/data. Always confirm:
    
    - Backup timestamp
        
    - Backup contents
        
    - Purpose of the restoration
        

### 🔐 Permissions & Ownership

- Set options like `--owner`, `--no-owner` if you’re restoring under a different user.
    
- Restore might **DROP and recreate** schemas or objects if allowed.
    

---

## 📊 Viewing Backup Contents

- Use the `--list` option in `pg_restore` to preview backup contents:
	
	bash
	
    `pg_restore --list -f backup_file.tar`
    
- Helps ensure you're restoring the correct elements (schemas, tables, roles, etc.).

## 💡 Best Practices

✅ Always check backup file before restoration  
✅ Use **different database name** for testing restores  
✅ Use `--verbose` for detailed logs  
✅ Run restoration during low-traffic hours  
✅ Use compressed backups (e.g., `.tar`, `.gz`) to save space  
✅ Monitor for errors and warnings during restoration

## 🛠️ What’s Next?

In the **next class**, you’ll learn to:

- Automate backups using scripts 🧑‍💻
    
- Schedule regular backups ⏰
    
- Ensure backups follow a consistent routine 📅
    

🧠 Remember: _The more sensitive your data, the more critical it is to have a solid backup and restoration plan!_
