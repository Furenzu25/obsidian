# 🐧 Linux Shell Scripts for PostgreSQL Backups – Study Notes

## 📚 Overview

In this class, we explored **automated backup scripts using Shell scripting** in a **Linux environment**. These scripts help simplify and streamline the backup process for PostgreSQL databases.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Understand the importance of **automated backups**
    
- Learn how to **configure shell scripts** for PostgreSQL backup and rotation
    
- Explore **best practices** for secure and efficient storage

## 🧠 Why Backups Matter

- Backups protect against **data loss, corruption, or hardware failure**
    
- Always better to **back up too much** than to realize it's too late
    
- Store backups in:
    
    - 📦 External HDs
        
    - ☁️ Cloud services
        
    - 🔐 Secure offline locations

## 🛠 Files and Their Roles

### 1. `pg_backup_config`

- Main configuration file:
    
    - 🔐 **Username & Password**
        
    - 🌐 **Host & Port**
        
    - 📁 **Directory** to save backups (will be auto-created if missing)
        
    - 🧱 **Schema selection** (to back up specific schemas)
        
    - 🗜️ **Format** (prefer compressed backups for space & performance)
        
- Choose between:
    
    - **Global backups** (users, passwords, full cluster)
        
    - **Selective backups** (specific DBs, schemas, tables)
        

### 2. `pg_backup.sh`

- The **primary backup script**:
    
    - Uses the settings from `pg_backup_config`
        
    - Automatically:
        
        - Creates folders by 📅 **date (YYYY-MM-DD)**
            
        - Compresses the SQL backups
            
        - Backs up all databases individually
            
    - Avoids repeated password prompts by embedding credentials
        
    - Produces backups with `.sql.gz` extension
        

### 3. `pg_backup_rotate.sh`

- **Rotation script** to manage backup retention:
    
    - Deletes 📂 **old backups automatically**
        
    - Retention period can be customized:
        
        - ⏳ Number of days to keep backups
            
        - 🗓️ Weekly or daily backup schedule
            
    - Use with `crontab` to automate deletion
        

---

## 🔄 Automation with `crontab`

- `crontab` allows you to **schedule backups**:
    
    - 🕐 Define exact **day/time** for scripts to run
        
    - 🚫 Avoid manual execution
        
- Example: Schedule a backup every **Friday (Day 5)**
    

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Be careful with `rm -f`: ❌ This command **permanently deletes files**
    
- Always **double-check backup directories** before running deletion scripts
    
- Shell script knowledge is essential for customizing or debugging these scripts
    

---

## 💻 Execution Steps

1. Ensure all `.sh` files and `pg_backup_config` are correctly set
    
2. Use a **Shell interpreter** (like `bash`) to run scripts
    
3. Upon execution:
    
    - Directories and backups are auto-generated
        
    - Files include global configurations, schema, SQL data, and users
        
4. Output directory example: `/root/2021-03-31/`
    
    - Includes `.sql.gz` compressed files for all databases
        

---

## ✅ Summary

- These scripts allow **automated, scheduled PostgreSQL backups** on Linux
    
- They help you maintain secure, space-efficient, and organized backup routines
    
- Using `crontab` ensures backups happen consistently without manual effort
    
- Backup rotation keeps your system clean and manageable
    

---

## 👋 Final Tips

- Practice using shell scripts and `crontab` on a test environment
    
- Adjust backup frequency and retention based on your data's importance
    
- Use this system to confidently manage PostgreSQL backups in production
