# 🧠 PostgreSQL Backup Compression – Study Notes

## 🎓 Topic Overview

In this class, we explored **compression algorithms** used in PostgreSQL backups, particularly focusing on how different compression methods affect **file size** and **backup speed**.

---

## 🔍 Key Compression Methods

PostgreSQL introduced support for **new compression algorithms** starting from **version 16**. Here's a breakdown of the main types discussed:

### 1. 🪙 **GZIP (.gz)**

- ✅ **Most common**, widely supported (legacy)
    
- ⚖️ Good balance of compression size and speed
    
- 🕰️ Average performance in tests
    
- 📦 Example output: ~27MB
    

### 2. 💨 **LZ4**

- ⚡ Focus on **speed** over size
    
- 🧱 Larger backup size than GZIP
    
- 📦 Example output: ~50MB
    
- ⚠️ Best for quick backups where storage space isn’t critical
    

### 3. 🧬 **ZSTD (Zstandard)**

- 🆕 Introduced in **PostgreSQL 16**
    
- 🥇 Best compression rate: **~80% smaller** than ZIP
    
- 📦 Example output: ~8MB
    
- 🐢 Slightly slower than others in small tests, but scales well for **large databases**
    
- 🔐 Newer algorithm with excellent **performance-to-compression ratio**

## 🧪 Practical Comparison: Test Results

|Compression Type|Approx. Size|Speed|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|
|**ZSTD**|8 MB|Slower|Best size, newer algorithm|
|**GZIP (.gz)**|27 MB|Moderate|Balanced and compatible|
|**LZ4**|50 MB|Fastest|Biggest size, great speed|

⚠️ These tests were run on a ~1.5 GB dataset.

## 🛠 How to Use in PostgreSQL

- You can select the compression method using the `pg_dump` command
    
- Default compression depends on your setup (usually `.gz`)
    
- Example formats: `.gz`, `.lz4`, `.zst`
    

bash

CopyEdit

`pg_dump -Fc --compress=zstd -f mybackup.zst mydatabase`

👆 Replace `zstd` with `lz4` or leave default for `.gz`.

---

## 📌 Key Takeaways

- ✅ **GZIP** is a safe, well-supported default
    
- 🏎️ **LZ4** is best for **speed**, not for saving space
    
- 🧠 **ZSTD** is optimal for **space savings**, especially for **large databases**
    
- 🔁 All these formats can be used with `pg_dump` as long as your **PostgreSQL version is 16 or higher**
    
- ⚠️ ZSTD and LZ4 are **not backward compatible** with versions earlier than 16

## 🧩 When to Use What?

|Scenario|Best Compression Method|
|---|---|
|🗃️ Large database, limited space|ZSTD|
|⏱️ Need fast backup/restore|LZ4|
|🔁 Compatibility required|GZIP|

## 👋 Final Thoughts

This lesson gives a hands-on view of how **PostgreSQL backup compression** works in practice. By testing different formats, we now understand the trade-offs between **speed** and **compression ratio**.

💬 If you're managing large databases, consider switching to **ZSTD** for better storage efficiency.

📅 Until next time — happy backing up! 🚀
