# 🧠 pgBackRest: PostgreSQL Backup & Restore – Study Notes

## 🎓 Topic Overview

**pgBackRest** is a robust, feature-rich backup and restoration tool for PostgreSQL databases. It goes beyond native PostgreSQL tools with added performance, security, and automation features, making it ideal for production environments.

---

## 🔍 Key Features of pgBackRest

pgBackRest offers advanced capabilities for enterprise-level PostgreSQL backup strategies:

### 🔄 Backup Options

•✅ **Full backup** – complete snapshot of the database  
•📊 **Differential backup** – changes since last full backup  
•📉 **Incremental backup** – changes since any prior backup  
•🧹 **Automatic cleanup** – removes outdated backups per policy  
•🔁 **Retention control** – manage how many backups to retain

### ⚡ Performance Features

•🚀 Parallel processing for faster backups  
•📦 Compression support: BZ2, GZ, LZ4, ZST  
•🔁 Backup resume if interrupted  
•🌐 Remote and local backups

### 🔐 Security and Integrity

•🔐 AES-256 directory encryption  
•🧪 Archive integrity verification  
•☁️ Cloud-compatible: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud  
•🔑 One-time encryption key (cannot be changed later)

---

## 🛠️ Installation Process

### Prerequisites

•📦 EPEL repository installed (Red Hat systems)  
•🐘 PostgreSQL repository installed

### Installation Command

bash

CopyEdit

`dnf install pgbackrest`

⚠️ **Run pgBackRest as the `postgres` user**, _not root_.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Steps

|Step|Action|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|1️⃣|**Edit PostgreSQL Config**|Locate using `SHOW config_file`; set: archive_mode, archive_command, wal_level, listen_addresses, password encryption (SHA-2 preferred)|
|2️⃣|**Set Up Backup Directory**|Create a secure location: `mkdir -p /var/lib/pgbackrest`|
|3️⃣|**Generate Encryption Key**|`openssl rand -base64 48`; 🔐 **Save this key** securely|
|4️⃣|**Edit pgBackRest Config**|Define compression, repo path, cipher, retention, logging|
|5️⃣|**Initialize Instance**|`pgbackrest --stanza=demo --create-instance`|
|6️⃣|**Enable WAL Archiving**|Required for incremental/differential backups|
|🔁|**Restart PostgreSQL**|After config changes: `systemctl restart postgresql-[ver]`|

## 🚀 Backup Operations

### ✅ 1. System Check

bash

CopyEdit

`sudo -iu postgres pgbackrest --stanza=demo check`

• Verifies configuration, repo access, and system readiness

---

### 📦 2. Full Backup

bash

CopyEdit

`sudo -iu postgres pgbackrest --stanza=demo backup`

• Compresses, encrypts, and backs up entire database  
• Required before differential or incremental backups

---

### 🔄 3. Differential Backup

bash

CopyEdit

`sudo -iu postgres pgbackrest --stanza=demo backup --type=diff`

• Only changes since last full backup  
• Requires valid full backup to exist  
• Set using `repo-retention-diff`

---

### 📊 4. Incremental Backup

bash

CopyEdit

`sudo -iu postgres pgbackrest --stanza=demo backup --type=incr`

• Smallest and fastest backup  
• Depends on full and diff backups  
• Ideal for frequent, space-saving backups

---

### ℹ️ 5. View Backup Info
	
	bash
	
`sudo -iu postgres pgbackrest --stanza=demo info`

• Shows backup metadata: sizes, timestamps, WAL logs

---

## 📝 Backup Types Comparison

|Backup Type|What It Saves|Dependency|Size|Speed|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Full**|Entire database|None|Largest|Slowest|
|**Differential**|Changes since last full|Full backup|Medium|Moderate|
|**Incremental**|Changes since last backup|Full + Diff|Smallest|Fastest|

⚠️ Incremental backups **expire** with their parent **differential** backups.

---

## 🔄 Retention & Rotation

• Set retention in pgBackRest config file:
	
	ini
	
	`[global] repo-retention-full=2 repo-retention-diff=2`

•🧹 Old backups are **auto-removed** when limits are exceeded  
•Plan wisely to balance storage space vs. recovery window

---

## 📌 Key Best Practices

•🔐 Store backups on secure, separate volumes  
•🧪 Regularly test backups with restore simulations  
•🔑 Encryption key **cannot be changed** after setup  
•☁️ Consider off-site/cloud storage for redundancy  
•🧠 Understand your RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective)  
•👤 Always use the **`postgres`** user for pgBackRest operations
