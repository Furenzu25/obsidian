 # 🔄 **pgBackRest: Backup & Restoration – Study Notes**

## 🎓 Class Summary

In this session, we focused on **restoring PostgreSQL databases using `pgBackRest`**, covering two critical real-world scenarios:

1. **Full system restoration after disaster**
    
2. **Point-in-time restore (PITR) for a specific database**
    

These processes simulate real-life disasters (like data loss or human error) and demonstrate how to recover your data confidently and efficiently.

## ⚠️ Scenario 1: Full System Disaster Recovery

### 🧨 Simulation: System Crash

We began by simulating a **total failure**:

- Stopped the PostgreSQL instance
    
- Deleted the entire PostgreSQL data directory (simulating disk loss or corruption)
    

### 🛠️ Recovery Steps

1. **Recreate the data directory**
    
	bash
	
    `mkdir -p /var/lib/pgsql/data chown postgres:postgres /var/lib/pgsql/data chmod 700 /var/lib/pgsql/data`
    
2. **Restore full backup using pgBackRest**
	
	bash
	
    `sudo -u postgres pgbackrest --stanza=demo restore`
    
    - `--stanza=demo`: points to your backup configuration
        
    - Uses symbolic links (`latest`) to reference the most recent backup
        
    - Must restore to the **same directory** as the original PostgreSQL instance
        
3. **Restart PostgreSQL service**
	
	bash
	
    `systemctl start postgresql`
    
4. **Verify restoration**
    
    - All previous databases were restored successfully
        
    - `psql` shows databases like `postgres`, `mysql`, and `test2` were intact

## 🔁 Scenario 2: Point-in-Time Restore (PITR)

### 🧪 Simulation: Human Error (Database Deletion)

1. **Create a new database** called `test_backup`
    
2. **Insert sample data** (~90,000 rows)
    
3. **Perform an incremental backup**
	
	bash
	
    `sudo -u postgres pgbackrest --stanza=demo --type=incr backup`
    
    - Captures only the recent change (i.e., the new `test_backup` database)
        
    - Smaller, faster, and more space-efficient than full backups
        
4. **Delete the test database**
	
		sql
	
    `DROP DATABASE test_backup;`
    

---

### 🧰 Restore the Deleted Database (PITR)

1. **Stop PostgreSQL service**
	
		bash
	
    `systemctl stop postgresql`
    
2. **Run point-in-time restore for the deleted DB**
	
		bash
	
    `sudo -u postgres pgbackrest --stanza=demo restore --db-include=test_backup --type=immediate --delta --target-action=promote`
    
    - `--db-include`: restores only that database
        
    - `--type=immediate`: restores from the latest available backup
        
    - `--delta`: skips re-extracting already existing unchanged files
        
    - `--target-action=promote`: promotes to master after restore
        
3. **Restart PostgreSQL and verify**
	
		bash
	
    `systemctl start postgresql psql -l`
    
    - The `test_backup` database reappears
        
    - Row count confirms all 90,000 rows were preserved

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

✅ **Full Restore:** Use when your entire system is lost or corrupted  
✅ **PITR:** Use for targeted restoration, e.g., accidental deletion of one DB  
📌 **Same directory names** are required for proper restoration  
🔐 Use `pgBackRest` as the `postgres` user (not root)  
📊 **Incremental backups** are fast, efficient, and save disk space  
🛡️ Always verify your restores by checking database existence and row integrity  
📁 The `latest` backup symlink makes version selection easy  
🧪 Practice recovery regularly to be ready for real-world issues

## 📚 What You Learned

- How to simulate and recover from a **complete PostgreSQL disaster**
    
- How to perform **incremental backups**
    
- How to recover **only one deleted database** without affecting others
    
- How to interpret `pgBackRest` info and use correct flags
    
- Real-world importance of **disaster recovery planning**

## 👋 Final Words

Backups are only useful if you can **reliably restore them**.  
With `pgBackRest`, you gain powerful tools to protect your PostgreSQL environment from both system failures and human errors.

🔄 _Backup regularly. Restore often. Trust nothing until tested._
