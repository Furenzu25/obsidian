# 🧠 PostgreSQL Study Notes: Full Backup & WAL Files Configuration (Lesson Summary)

## 📌 Objective

This lesson is focused on setting up **PostgreSQL backups** using **WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)** for **Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR)**. We’ll prepare our server, perform a **full backup**, generate **WAL files**, and prepare the system for a **real-time backup and recovery** process.

---

## 🖥️ Environment Setup

- Ensure PostgreSQL is fully installed and **running properly**.
    
- No additional configuration is needed before starting.
    
- A **Linux-based server** (e.g., Rocky Linux, Alma Linux, RedHat) is recommended for better security and control.

## 📁 Directory Structure

### 🗂️ Backup Directory Creation

1. Create a **full backup directory** named with the current `day-month-year`.
    
2. Ensure the **Postgres user owns** the directory.
    
3. Set **secure permissions**:
    
    - Owner: full access
        
    - Group: read-only
        
    - Others: no access
        
    
    bash
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `chmod 740 backup_directory/`
    

### 📦 WAL Archive Directory

1. Create a directory specifically for **WAL files**.
    
2. Same ownership and permissions as above to maintain security and isolation.
    
3. This directory should **ideally be on a separate disk or remote server** for redundancy and protection.

## 🧾 Performing a Full Backup

Use the following command to generate a **full backup**:

bash

CopyEdit

`pg_basebackup -U postgres -D /path/to/backup -F t -z -P -X stream`

### Breakdown:

- `-F t`: Format (tar)
    
- `-z`: Compress the backup
    
- `-P`: Show progress
    
- `-X stream`: Generate WAL files during backup
    

🧠 _Note: A checkpoint is triggered before backup starts to clean up old WAL files._

## ⚙️ Configuring PostgreSQL for Real-Time WAL Archiving

### 🔧 Edit `postgresql.conf`:

Locate the file (use `updatedb` and `locate postgresql.conf` if needed), and update these settings:

1. **Enable archiving**:
    
    conf
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `archive_mode = on`
    
2. **Specify WAL archiving command**:
    
    conf
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `archive_command = 'cp %p /path/to/wal_archive/%f'`
    
    - `%p`: Path of source WAL file
        
    - `%f`: File name
        
3. **Set WAL file sizes** (optional tuning):
    
    conf
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `wal_segment_size = 1GB  # Max min_wal_size = 80MB     # Min`
    
4. **Set WAL level**:
    
    conf
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `wal_level = replica`
    
    - `replica`: Recommended (logs all needed changes)
        
    - `minimal`: Fewer details (not ideal for PITR)
        
    - `logical`: For logical decoding
        

💡 _Only change the above parameters. Avoid unnecessary edits to maintain stability._

### ✅ Apply Changes:

Restart PostgreSQL to apply the configuration:

bash

CopyEdit

`systemctl restart postgresql`

## 🧪 WAL File Generation in Real-Time

### 📅 Tracking WAL Activity

- Note the **timestamp** before executing any command.
    
- WAL files are created whenever **data is modified** (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE`).
    
- **`SELECT` commands do NOT trigger WAL creation**.
    

### 🔨 Demo Commands to Trigger WALs:

sql

CopyEdit

`-- Inside psql shell CREATE DATABASE test; \c test; CREATE TABLE test_table AS SELECT * FROM generate_series(1, 1000000);`

⏱️ Check the archive directory. You’ll now see **new WAL files**, each typically **16MB** in size.

📉 You can **compress** WAL files later to save space (1.9MB per file compressed).

## 🧩 Summary Flow

1. 🔧 Configure PostgreSQL for archiving.
    
2. 📁 Create directories for full backup & WALs.
    
3. 📦 Run a **full backup**.
    
4. 🧪 Perform database operations to generate WALs.
    
5. 🗃️ WAL files are stored in real-time.
    
6. 📆 Record timestamps to assist with **PITR**.
    
7. 🔁 In the next lesson, simulate a failure and **restore** the database using:
    
    - Full backup
        
    - WAL files to restore changes made after backup
        

---

## 🛡️ Tips & Best Practices

- Always store backups and WALs on **separate disks or remote servers** 🌐.
    
- Follow the **principle of redundancy** for production environments.
    
- Set **proper ownership and permissions** to prevent unauthorized access 🔐.
    
- Use **compression** to save disk space.
    
- Keep track of the **date and time** when backups and WALs are created 📆.
