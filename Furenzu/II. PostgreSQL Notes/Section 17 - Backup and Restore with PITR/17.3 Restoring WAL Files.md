# 📘 Study Notes: PostgreSQL Backup & Recovery (Full + WAL)

## 🎯 Objective:

Learn how to **simulate a PostgreSQL disaster**, delete all data, and **fully restore** using:

- A **Full Backup**
    
- **WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)** files
    

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Breakdown:

### 1. **Simulate a Disaster 💥**

- Stop the PostgreSQL service (daemon).
    
- Delete the entire data directory (this simulates a server crash/fire/data loss).
    
- Ensure only your **backup files** remain.
    

### 2. **Recreate the PostgreSQL Environment 🛠️**

- Recreate the empty data directory:
	
		bash
	
    `mkdir /usr/local/pgsql/data`
    
- Set the correct permissions:
	
		bash
	
    `chown postgres:postgres /usr/local/pgsql/data chmod 750 /usr/local/pgsql/data`
    

### 3. **Create `recovery.signal` File 🚨**

- This file signals PostgreSQL to enter recovery mode during startup:
	
		bash
	
    `touch /usr/local/pgsql/data/recovery.signal`
    
- It triggers recovery from the **full backup first**, then applies WAL files for point-in-time recovery.
    

---

## 🗂️ 4. Restore Full Backup (.tar)

- Extract the full backup to the new data directory:
	
		bash
	
    `tar -xvf [backup_file].tar -C /usr/local/pgsql/data`
    

✔️ This also includes your `recovery.signal` file.

---

## 📂 5. Restore WAL Files

- WAL files go **into their own WAL archive directory** (not inside the data directory).
    
- Example WAL file location:
	
		bash
	
    `/usr/local/pgsql/wal_archive`
    
- Verify WAL file order using:
	
		bash
	
    `ls -lh /usr/local/pgsql/wal_archive`
    

🧠 WAL files follow a sequential naming pattern (e.g., 000000020000000000000002, etc.)

---

## 📅 6. Configure `postgresql.conf` for Restore

- Edit the file:
	
		bash
	
    `nano /usr/local/pgsql/data/postgresql.conf`
    
- Add the **restore command**:
	
		bash
	
    `restore_command = 'cp /usr/local/pgsql/wal_archive/%f "%p"'`
    
- Set the **recovery target time** to just before the crash:
	
		bash
	
    `recovery_target_time = '2025-01-09 11:17:00'`
    

📌 Make sure this timestamp corresponds to the last known good state (from the logs).

---

## 🔁 7. Restart PostgreSQL in Recovery Mode

- Start Postgres using:
	
		bash
	
    `pg_ctl start -D /usr/local/pgsql/data -l logfile`
    
- Monitor logs in real-time (very important!):
	
		bash
	
    `tail -f /usr/local/pgsql/data/logfile`
    

🧑‍💻 Logs show you:

- File recovery
    
- WAL application
    
- Recovery success/failure
    

---

## ✅ 8. Finalize the Recovery

- If PostgreSQL stays in **standby (recovery) mode**, finish with:
	
		sql
	
    `SELECT pg_wal_replay_resume();`
    
- This moves Postgres back to accepting connections. It's now **fully restored and operational**.
    

---

## 🧪 9. Test the Recovery

- Connect via `psql` and check your databases:
	
		bash
	
    `psql -U postgres \l \c test SELECT * FROM your_table;`
    

📊 You should see:

- **No data loss** (even post-backup inserts are retained if WAL worked)
    
- **Restored test database and table records**
    

---

## 📝 Key Reminders:

- Always monitor logs 📄 in **real time**.
    
- Use `recovery.signal` to start recovery mode.
    
- Use both **Full Backup** + **WAL files** for full data fidelity.
    
- `restore_command` and `recovery_target_time` in `postgresql.conf` are **critical**.
    
- After recovery, restart using the standard daemon (`systemctl start postgresql` or similar).
    
- Test everything before going to production!

## 💡 Final Tip:

Backup and recovery are the most delicate parts of a DBA’s job. Always double-check timestamps, log files, and file integrity before proceeding with production.
