# 🧠 Study Notes: PostgreSQL WAL Files & Replication Explained

## 👋 Introduction

Hello students! Today’s session dives deeper into **WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)** files and how they are **replicated** across PostgreSQL instances. We’ll explore:

- What WAL files are
    
- Types of PostgreSQL replication
    
- How WAL replication works in practice
    
- The difference between synchronous and asynchronous replication
    
- Use of multiple instances for redundancy and safety

## 🔄 What Are WAL Files?

- **WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)** ensures data consistency in PostgreSQL.
    
- Changes are first written to WAL files before being written to the actual database.
    
- Used to recover databases in case of crashes or failures.
    
- Each WAL file = **16MB** in size.

## 🔁 Types of PostgreSQL Replication

### 1. **Asynchronous Streaming Replication (Default)** 🚀

- Uses `WAL Sender` on the **primary** PostgreSQL instance to send WAL files.
    
- Receiver is a **read-only** standby server.
    
- Files are shipped **after** the WAL file reaches 16MB.
    
- ⚠️ Risk: In case of a crash, any WAL file not yet sent could be lost.
    
- ✅ Advantage: Faster performance, low latency.
    

**How it works:**
	
	psql
	
`Primary Server (Write/Read)     │ WAL Sender ➡ WAL Receiver     │   Standby Server (Read-Only)`

### 2. **Synchronous Replication (Safer, Slower)** 🔐

- Data is committed only **after** confirmation from the standby that it received the WAL files.
    
- Ensures **stronger data integrity**, even if there is a crash.
    
- Files are shipped only after they reach 16MB.
    
- Slight delay in replication due to confirmation roundtrips.
    

**Commit Process in Sync Mode:**

1. `BEGIN`
    
2. `INSERT` / other DML
    
3. WAL File created and sent
    
4. `COMMIT` only when replica acknowledges

## 📋 Synchronous Modes

|Mode|Description|Speed|Safety|
|---|---|---|---|
|`off`|No waiting for replication confirmation|Fastest|❌ Unsafe|
|`on`|Waits for WAL reception confirmation|Moderate|✅ Good|
|`remote_apply`|Waits until the standby has **applied** the transaction|Slowest|✅✅ Very Safe|

💡 **Recommendation:** Use `remote_apply` if **data consistency is critical**, even at the cost of speed.

## 🖥 Setup Strategy

🎯 For best practice, use **three PostgreSQL instances**:

- `PG1`: Primary Server
    
- `PG2`: Standby for **asynchronous** replication
    
- `PG3`: Standby for **synchronous** replication
    

🔁 Both replication methods can run in parallel:

- Simultaneous streaming to two standby nodes
    
- Helps understand differences in real-time
    

---

## 🔍 Final Thoughts

- **WAL replication** is crucial for **disaster recovery**, **scalability**, and **high availability**.
    
- Choose your replication method based on your system's priorities: speed vs. safety.
    
- Monitoring and understanding WAL behavior is essential for DBA professionals.
    
- The **next class** will dive into the **hands-on setup** and demonstrate these concepts live.

## ✅ Summary

|Topic|Summary|
|---|---|
|WAL Files|Record database changes before applying them; size = 16MB|
|Async Replication|Faster, but risk of data loss if crash happens before WAL is sent|
|Sync Replication|Slower but ensures no data loss with commit confirmation from standby|
|Recommended Setup|Use 3 servers for full redundancy and to test both async/sync methods|
|Safe Mode Suggestion|Use `remote_apply` for highest reliability|
