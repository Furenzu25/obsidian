# 📝 Study Notes: PostgreSQL Asynchronous WAL File Replication

👋 **Hello everyone!**  
Hope you’re doing well. In this class, we explored **asynchronous replication in PostgreSQL** using **WAL (Write-Ahead Log) files**. Here's a structured summary of what was covered, along with the necessary steps and concepts.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 🔄 What is Asynchronous Replication?

- It’s the **default method** used by PostgreSQL for replication.
    
- Focuses on **speed and performance**, not immediate consistency.
    
- WAL files are shipped to the standby as soon as possible but **not guaranteed to be current at any given moment**.
    

---

## 🖥️ Setup Requirements

### 🔧 Machines Needed:

- **Two machines**: One **primary (PG1)** and one **standby (PG2)**.
    

---

## 🛠️ Configuration Steps

### 1. **Primary Server (PG1) Setup**

#### ✅ Requirements:

- PostgreSQL installed and running.
    
- Create a specific **replication user**:
    
    bash
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `CREATE USER user WITH REPLICATION ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'your_password';`
    

#### 🔧 Edit `postgresql.conf`:

Set the following parameters:

ini

CopyEdit

`wal_level = replica hot_standby = on wal_log_hints = on max_wal_senders = 10 wal_keep_size = 1GB  # or as needed`

#### 🔒 Configure `pg_hba.conf`:

Add a line at the top (order matters!):

conf

CopyEdit

`host replication user <standby_ip>/32 trust`

📝 **Note**: Trust authentication is only for demo/testing. Use `md5` in production.

Restart PostgreSQL to apply changes:

bash

CopyEdit

`systemctl restart postgresql`

---

### 2. **Standby Server (PG2) Setup**

#### 📁 Prepare Data Directory:

- If any previous data exists, delete it.
    
- Create a clean data directory:
    
    bash
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `mkdir /var/lib/pgsql/data chown postgres:postgres /var/lib/pgsql/data chmod 0750 /var/lib/pgsql/data`
    

#### 🧩 Clone Data from Primary:

Use `pg_basebackup`:

bash

CopyEdit

`pg_basebackup -h <primary_ip> -D /var/lib/pgsql/data -U user -P -R`

📌 `-R` auto-creates the `standby.signal` and recovery settings.

#### 🧰 Ensure PostgreSQL Tools Exist:

Install if missing:

bash

CopyEdit

`dnf install postgresql-server postgresql-contrib`

Link binaries if needed:

bash

CopyEdit

`ln -s /usr/pgsql-x/bin/* /usr/bin/`

---

## 🔄 Replication in Action

### ✅ Start PostgreSQL on Standby:

bash

CopyEdit

`systemctl start postgresql`

### 🔍 Check Replication Status:

Run on the **standby server**:

sql

CopyEdit

`SELECT * FROM pg_stat_wal_receiver \x;`

Check output for:

- `status = streaming`
    
- `sync_state = async`
    

You can also verify on the primary:

sql

CopyEdit

`SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication \x;`

---

## 🧪 Testing the Setup

### ✅ Create a Table on Primary:

sql

CopyEdit

`CREATE TABLE test (id INT); INSERT INTO test VALUES (1);`

### 🔍 Query on Standby:

sql

CopyEdit

`SELECT * FROM test;`

If results match, **replication is working perfectly** 🎉

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Any **PostgreSQL extensions** (like `pg_audit`, tablespaces, encryption tools, etc.) **must also be installed on the standby.**
    
- The standby is **read-only**: No `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` allowed.
    
- Make sure **firewall rules**, `SELinux`, and **network access** are configured properly.
    
- The replication user should **only** have permission for replication—not general DB access.
