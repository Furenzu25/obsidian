# 🧠 **Barman + Postgres Study Notes (Backup & Recovery Setup)**

## 🖥️ **Server Setup Overview**

- We are working with **two servers**:
    
    - **Postgres Server** 🐘: Production database.
        
    - **Barman Server** 🧃: Centralized backup server.
        
- Both servers must be operational and connected for this setup to work.
    

## 🔧 **Purpose of the Setup**

- **Centralized Backup System** using **Barman**.
    
- Enables **PITR (Point-In-Time Recovery)** and continuous archiving of **WAL (Write Ahead Logs)**.
    
- Dedicated backup server ensures isolation and reliability.
    
- Suitable for both **cloud** and **physical environments**.
    
    - 🛡️ Cloud recommendation: Use **another cloud provider** for security.

## 🛠️ **Installation Steps**

### 1. ⚙️ **Install Required Repositories**

- Use **EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux)** for dependencies.
    
- Add **official PostgreSQL repositories**.
    

### 2. 📦 **Install Postgres Binaries (on Barman Server)**

- Only the **binaries** are needed (not the DB):
    
    - `pg_basebackup`
        
    - `pg_receivewal`
        
- Install them to a standard directory like `/sbin` so that the Barman user can access them.
    

### 3. 📦 **Install Barman CLI**

- Installed on both:
    
    - **Barman server**
        
    - **Postgres server**
        
- Available in the official PostgreSQL repos.

## 🧾 **Configuration Files**

Barman uses **two types of config files**:

### 1. 🌐 **Global Config File**

Path: `/etc/barman.conf`

- You should **backup the original** and create a new config from scratch.
    
- INI-style format, includes:
    
    - `barman_user = barman`
        
    - `configuration_files_directory = /etc/barman.d/`
        
    - `log_file`, `log_level = info`
        
    - `compression = gzip`
        
    - `minimum_redundancy = 3`
        
    - `retention_policy = -4 weeks`
        

### 2. 🎯 **Server-Specific Config**

Path: `/etc/barman.d/<your_server_name>.conf`

- The **name inside the square brackets** (`[name]`) must match the server’s identity.
    
- Key fields:
    
    - `description = Postgres Backup - Region X`
        
    - `conninfo = host=postgres user=barman dbname=postgres`
        
    - `ssh_command = ssh postgres@<host>`
        
    - `streaming_conninfo = host=postgres user=streaming_barman dbname=postgres`
        
    - `slot_name = barman`
        
    - `backup_method = postgres`
        
    - `streaming_archiver = on`
        
    - `path_prefix = /usr/pgsql-16/bin/` (adjust for version)
        
    - `backup_directory = /var/lib/barman/backups/postgres`
        
    - `retention_policy = RECOVERY WINDOW OF 7 DAYS`
        
    - `wal_retention_policy = main`
        
    - `minimum_redundancy = 2`

## 🪛 **System Preparation Tips**

- 🧭 **Edit `/etc/hosts`** on both machines for easy hostname resolution.
    
- ✅ **Ping test** by hostname to verify connectivity.
    
- 🧼 **Standardize binary paths**: Ensure binaries are in system path (`/bin`, `/sbin`).
    
- 💾 Monitor disk usage: Since it’s a backup server, space optimization (e.g., `gzip`) is key.

## 🔐 **Security and Monitoring**

- 🛠️ Use **SSH key-based authentication** (setup covered in the next class).
    
- 🧑‍💻 Create two users in PostgreSQL:
    
    - `barman` – used for general backup access.
        
    - `streaming_barman` – used specifically for WAL streaming.
        
- 🧪 Always **test before production**.
    
- 📈 Set up a **monitoring system** to keep track of backup jobs, logs, failures, etc.
    

---

## ⏭️ **Next Steps (Covered in Next Class)**

- Create and configure SSH keys for secure, password-less communication between servers.
    
- Finalize PostgreSQL permissions and streaming slots.
    
- Begin executing and testing full backups and PITR scenarios.

### ✅ Summary

This session was all about preparing a stable, centralized, and production-ready **Barman backup system** for a PostgreSQL environment. We focused on installation, file configuration, security setup groundwork, and laid the foundation for real-time WAL streaming and PITR recovery.
