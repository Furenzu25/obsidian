# 🧠 Study Notes: SSH Setup & Postgres Replication Configuration with Barman 🐘🔐

---

## 🔑 SSH Key Creation & Exchange

### 💻 On the Barman Server

1. **Log in as `barman` user**:
    
    - `su - barman`
        
    - Confirm with `pwd` – you're in the home directory (likely `/var/lib/barman`).
        
    - This user is not a typical system user; it's an application-level user.
        
2. **Create SSH Key**:
    
    - Run: `ssh-keygen`
        
    - Just press **Enter** at every prompt (no password needed).
        
    - Keys will be created in a hidden `.ssh` folder.
        

### 💻 On the Postgres Server

1. **Log in as `postgres` user**:
    
    - `su - postgres`
        
2. **Set password**:
    
    - Run: `passwd`
        
    - Use: `123456` (or any chosen secure password)
        
3. **Create SSH Key** (same as Barman):
    
    - `ssh-keygen`
        
    - Just press **Enter**, no password.

## 🔁 SSH Key Exchange

### 🔁 From Barman to Postgres

- As `barman`:
    
    - `ssh-copy-id postgres@<Postgres IP>`
        
    - Accept fingerprint prompt: type `yes`
        
    - Enter password: `123456`
        

### 🔁 From Postgres to Barman

- As `postgres`:
    
    - `ssh-copy-id barman@<Barman IP>`
        
    - Accept fingerprint prompt: type `yes`
        
    - Enter password: `123456`
        

✅ **Result:** Both servers can now SSH into each other **password-free**.

## 👥 User Setup for Replication

### 🎯 Create 2 Users in Postgres

1. **Barman User** – for backup
    
2. **Streaming Barman User** – for replication
    

Use the following command:
	
	bash
	
`createuser --superuser --pwprompt barman`

Password: `123456`

Repeat for `streaming_barman` user.

## 🔐 Granting Permissions to Barman

Inside the Postgres terminal (`psql`):

### 📋 Permissions to Grant:
	
	sql
	
`GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_start_backup(text, boolean) TO barman; GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_stop_backup() TO barman; GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_switch_wal() TO barman; GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_create_restore_point(text) TO barman; GRANT pg_read_all_settings TO barman; GRANT pg_read_all_stats TO barman; GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_checkpoint() TO barman;`

📝 These permissions allow `barman` to:

- Initiate backups
    
- Access WAL (Write-Ahead Logging)
    
- Perform checkpoints
    
- Access server configs/stats

## ⚙️ Postgres Configuration (`postgresql.conf`)

### ✏️ Key Parameters to Update:
	
	c
	
`listen_addresses = '*' wal_level = replica max_wal_senders = 2 hot_standby = on archive_command = 'barman-wal-archive postgres-streaming %p' archive_mode = on`

📌 Notes:

- `max_wal_senders`: Set based on number of replicas.
    
- `archive_command`: Tells Postgres where to send WAL logs for Barman.
    

---

## 🛡️ Access Control (`pg_hba.conf`)

Add:
	
	c
	
`host    replication     streaming_barman    <Barman IP>/32    trust`

- Use `trust` authentication for replication only.
    
- Ensure IP is fixed.
    
- This ensures only the Barman server can replicate.

## 🔄 Final Steps

### 🔁 Restart Postgres Daemon
	
	bash
	
`systemctl restart postgresql`

---

## 🧭 Next Steps (Teaser for Next Class)

➡️ Return to the **Barman server**  
➡️ Finalize backup configuration  
➡️ Begin actual **backup operations**

---

### ✅ Summary Checklist

-  Created SSH keys for both servers
    
-  Performed SSH key exchange
    
-  Created `barman` & `streaming_barman` users
    
-  Granted required permissions
    
-  Configured `postgresql.conf` and `pg_hba.conf`
    
-  Restarted Postgres
    

🎉 You're now set up for secure, password-free access and ready to start streaming replication and backups with Barman!
