# 🧠 Study Notes – Barman Backup Server Configuration & Testing

## ✅ Configuration Recap

- We've completed our initial setup and restarted the **PostgreSQL daemon**.
    
- Now we continue with the final steps on our **Barman backup server**.
    

---

## 🔐 Creating `.pgpass` (Credentials File)

- Navigate to the Barman user’s home directory (`/home/barman` or `/var/lib/barman`).
    
- Create a hidden file:
		
		bash
		
    `vim .pgpass`
    
- Inside the file, add the following:
		
		ruby
		
    `hostname:5432:postgres:barman:123456`
    
    Replace `hostname` and `123456` with your actual server and password.
    
- Secure it:
		
		bash
		
    `chmod 600 .pgpass`
    
- Verify permissions with:
		
		bash
		
    `ls -la .pgpass`
    

---

## 🔌 Testing the Connection

- As the **Barman user**, test the direct connection to Postgres:
		 	
		bash
		
    `psql -U barman -h <postgres_host> -d postgres -c "SELECT version();"`
    
- You should see output confirming the Postgres version and system details (e.g., Rocky Linux).
    

---

## 🔁 Verifying Streaming Replication

- Check streaming replication status via:
		
		bash
		
    `barman check <server_name>`
    
- Output should show:
    
    - System ID
        
    - Timeline ID
        
    - Current WAL (Write-Ahead Log) position
        
- This confirms that the **Barman server can receive WAL files** from the Postgres server.
    

---

## 📦 Creating Replication Slots

- Replication slots may be created automatically.
    
- If not, run:
		
		bash
		
    `barman receive-wal --create-slot <server_name>`
    
- Ignore the “already created” error—this is expected if slots are pre-existing.
    

---

## 💾 Running the First Full Backup

- Initiate the first backup:
		
		bash
		
    `barman backup <server_name>`
    
- This will:
    
    - Save all WAL files 📂
        
    - Use **pg_basebackup** (not SSH)
        
    - Copy all database files
        
- Check backup status with:
		
		bash
		
    `barman list-backup <server_name>`
    

---

## 🔍 Validating Setup

Use these to verify that everything is functional:

- `barman check <server_name>` – checks for errors (ignore redundancy warning).
    
- `barman show-server <server_name>` – shows detailed settings.
    
- Compression is on (WAL files are compressed).
    
- Permissions, binaries, directories are correctly set.
    
- Connection and streaming are ✅ functional.

## 🌐 Cloud Compatibility

- Barman supports:
    
    - AWS ☁️
        
    - Azure 🌩️
        
    - Google Cloud (GCP) 🌐
        
- Configuration options include: `profile`, `region`, `endpoint`.

## 🔁 Real-Time Streaming in Action

- To simulate production:
    
    1. Create a new database:
			
			sql
			
        `CREATE DATABASE test;`
        
    2. Create a table with dummy data:
			
			sql
			
        `CREATE TABLE test_table AS SELECT * FROM generate_series(1, 1000000);`
        
    3. Monitor WAL file activity in real time:
			
			bash
			
        `tail -f /var/lib/barman/<server>/streaming.log`
        
- You’ll see WAL files being sent **instantly** as data is written.
    

---

## 📂 Where Are Backups Stored?

- Backup files are saved in:
		
		bash
		
    `/var/lib/barman/<server>/base/`
    
- WAL files are stored in:
    
    - `incoming/` 🔄
        
    - `streaming/` 📡

## 🧪 Upcoming: Restoration & Disaster Recovery

- In the **next session**, you’ll learn to:
    
    - Simulate a total loss (e.g., primary server crash).
        
    - Restore data from Barman backup.
        
- This is essential for **disaster recovery planning** 💥🛠️.

## ✅ Final Notes

- Everything is working:
    
    - Streaming replication ✅
        
    - Backups ✅
        
    - WAL file synchronization ✅
        
- Be sure to implement:
    
    - 🔍 Monitoring tools
        
    - 🪵 Log inspection systems
        
    - 🔐 Secure credentials handling
