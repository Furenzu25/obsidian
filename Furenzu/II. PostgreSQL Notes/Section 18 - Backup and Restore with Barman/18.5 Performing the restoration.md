# 🛠️ PostgreSQL Backup & Restore with Barman – Study Notes

## 🧠 What You Should Know First

- We use **Barman** as a backup and recovery manager for **PostgreSQL**.
    
- PostgreSQL generates **WAL (Write-Ahead Log)** files constantly. These are essential for point-in-time recovery.
    
- 🔁 You don’t need to make full backups all the time—**WAL files** capture changes after the full backup.

## 🗃️ Backup Process

1. **Initial Setup**:
    
    - Configuration is already done (as per previous class).
        
    - WAL archiving is active.
        
    - Files are being continuously sent to Barman.
        
2. **Create a Full Backup**:
    
    - Use `barman backup <server-name>`
        
    - It may take time, so pre-run before demonstration if needed.
        
    - The backup is saved with an **ID**. Important for restoration.
        
3. **Real-Time WAL File Tracking**:
    
    - Open a second terminal and monitor WAL logs using `tail` on the log file.
        
    - Every transaction generates WAL segments: e.g., `000000010000000000000021`, `22`, `23`, etc.

## 🧪 Simulating a System Failure

1. **System Crash**:
    
    - Simulate by stopping PostgreSQL: `systemctl stop postgres`
        
    - Delete PostgreSQL data directory: `rm -rf /var/lib/postgresql/data`
        
2. 🔥 At this point, PostgreSQL is **completely wiped out**.

## 🔁 Restoration Process

1. **Find the Last Valid Backup**:
    
    - Use `barman list-backup <server-name>` to get the latest backup ID.
        
    - Use `barman show-backup <server-name> <backup-id>` to inspect the backup details.
        
    - Identify the timestamp (e.g., **Jan 22, 4:37 PM**) for **recovery target**.
        
2. **Restore Command**:
		
		bash
		
    `barman recover --remote-ssh-command "ssh postgres@host" <server-name> <backup-id> /var/lib/postgresql/data`
    
    - Make sure to use **same PostgreSQL version**.
        
    - SSH keys should be configured.
        
3. **Check Restoration Logs**:
    
    - `tail -f /path/to/barman/logfile`
        
    - Observe stages:
        
        - Restoring full backup
            
        - Restoring WAL files
            
    - Final message: ✅ "Restore process completed"

## 🛠️ Post-Restoration Configuration

1. **Edit Configuration Files**:
    
    - `postgresql.auto.conf`
        
    - Set `recovery_target_time = '2025-01-22 16:37:00'` 🕓 (Match exactly the WAL timestamp)
        
    - Ensure archive command is restored:
			
			conf
			
        `archive_command = 'rsync -a %p barman@host:/path/%f'`
        
3. **Start PostgreSQL in Recovery Mode**:
    
    - `systemctl start postgres`
        
    - Logs will show recovery process in action
        
4. ✅ **Successful Restoration Output**:
    
    - Recovery ends with: `Database system is ready to accept connections`
        
    - Test restored data: `SELECT * FROM test_ab;`
        

---

## 📦 Important Cleanup

After successful recovery:

- Delete recovery files:
    
    - `postgresql.auto.conf`
        
    - `recovery.signal`
        
    - Other temporary recovery configs
        
- Remove fake archive commands created by Barman during recovery
    
- Restart PostgreSQL for normal production mode
    

---

## 🧪 Final Verification

- Create new tables to test if WAL archiving and replication is working:
		
		sql
		
    `CREATE TABLE test_abc (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, data TEXT);`
    
- Check Barman logs: ✅ WAL files should be generated and transferred
    

---

## ✅ Summary

- Barman allows for **efficient backup and reliable recovery**.
    
- Recovery relies on:
    
    - The **latest full backup**
        
    - All **WAL files** after that backup
        
- Ensure:
    
    - 🔐 SSH is configured
        
    - 🎯 Time-based recovery target is accurate
        
    - 🧹 Clean up post-restore artifacts
        
    - 🧪 Verify with test queries and logs

> 💡 **Pro Tip**: Always monitor log files during restoration (`tail -f`). This ensures that WAL files are being restored properly and no data is lost.
