## 🐘 PostgreSQL Cluster Setup – Study Notes

### 👋 Introduction

Welcome! In this session, we’ll be learning **how to create a PostgreSQL cluster** using multiple servers—ideal for ensuring high availability and fault tolerance in a production environment.

---

### 🧠 Key Concepts

- **PostgreSQL is not limited to a single instance.**
    
- We’ll be using **4 servers** (virtual or physical):
    
    - 🟢 1 **Primary server**
        
    - 🔵 2 **Standby servers**
        
    - 🟡 1 **Witness server**
        

---

### 🖥️ Machine Setup

You can use:

- 💻 **VirtualBox** (recommended: clone machines to simplify IP and hostname configuration)
    
- ☁️ **Cloud servers**
    
- 🧪 Or any environment that supports Linux (Rocky Linux 9)
    

All 4 servers must:

- Use the **same OS** (e.g., Rocky Linux 9)
    
- Use the **same PostgreSQL version** (e.g., v15 or your preferred version)

### 🔁 Replication ≠ Backup

**Important distinction:**

- Replication ensures real-time data synchronization between servers.
    
- It **does not replace backups**. Always maintain a proper backup strategy.

### 🏗️ Cluster Components

1. **Primary Server (pg1)**
    
    - Handles all operations: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
        
    - All data changes are replicated to standby servers
        
2. **Standby Servers (pg2, pg3)**
    
    - Passive replicas of the primary
        
    - Automatically sync data in real time
        
3. **Witness Server (pg_witness)**
    
    - Not part of the replication itself
        
    - Acts as a decision-maker 🧠 during failover
        
    - Elects a new **primary** if the current one fails (based on configured priorities)
        

---

### 🔧 Configuration & Tools

You'll be working with:

- 🔐 **SSH**
    
- 📂 **Linux configuration files**
    
- 🧩 Custom settings for replication and failover
    
- 📜 PostgreSQL configuration files
    

All steps will be provided with commands and files to follow 👨‍💻📑

---

### 🧭 Class Format & Requirements

- This is an **advanced-level class** 🧠⚙️
    
- Basic knowledge of:
    
    - Linux
        
    - Terminal commands
        
    - Networking (IP/hostname)
        
    - PostgreSQL setup
        

➡️ You’ll follow a **step-by-step** guide through the setup and configuration process.

### 🔢 Machine Naming Convention

|Server Role|Hostname|
|---|---|
|Primary|`pg1` 🟢|
|Standby #1|`pg2` 🔵|
|Standby #2|`pg3` 🔵|
|Witness Server|`pg_witness` 🟡|

---

### 🧩 Summary

- We’re creating a **PostgreSQL cluster** with 4 machines.
    
- Real-time replication will be configured between primary and standby nodes.
    
- A **witness server** ensures automatic failover if the primary goes down.
    
- All machines must be uniform in OS and PostgreSQL version.
    
- You'll need Linux and PostgreSQL knowledge to keep up.
    
- Don't worry—**every command will be provided and explained step-by-step**.
