# 🧠 Study Notes – PostgreSQL Cluster Setup: Master Server Configuration

---

## 👋 Introduction

Welcome! In this session, we are configuring the **main/master server** for our PostgreSQL cluster. This is the **central node** that will control and manage the entire cluster.

---

## ⚙️ Step 1: PostgreSQL Configuration (`postgresql.conf`)

### 📍 Location:

- Located in the **data directory**
    

### 🧾 Key Changes:

1. **Connections and Authentication Section:**
    
    - `listen_addresses = '*'` ➝ Allows connections from all hosts.
        
    - Use this setting for remote access and integration with `repmgr`.
        
2. **Replication Section:**
    
    - Set the following:
        
        - `wal_level = replica`
            
        - `max_wal_senders = 10`
            
        - `hot_standby = on`
            
        - `archive_mode = on`
            
    - These settings enable proper **replication** behavior between nodes.
        

✅ Save and exit the file after editing.

---

## 🔁 Step 2: Restart PostgreSQL

- Run: `systemctl restart postgresql` (as root)
    
- This applies all configuration changes.
    

---

## 📂 Step 3: Configure `repmgr` for the Master Node

### 🗂 File Location:

- `/etc/repmgr/15/repmgr.conf`  
    _(replace `15` with your actual PostgreSQL version)_
    

### 🔢 Configuration Highlights:
	
	ini
	
`node_id=1 node_name='node1' conninfo='host=pg1 user=repmgr dbname=repmgr' data_directory='/var/lib/postgresql/15/main' failover='automatic' promote_command='repmgr standby promote'`

#### 📝 Explanation:

- `node_id=1`: Unique ID for this node in the cluster.
    
- `node_name='node1'`: Can be customized.
    
- `conninfo`: Connects to itself (localhost) using the `repmgr` user/database.
    
- `data_directory`: Your PostgreSQL data directory. Important for replication and recovery.
    
- `failover`: Set to automatic for seamless failover.
    
- `promote_command`: Defines how a node is promoted to primary.
    

💡 **Note:** Replication ≠ Backup. Replication provides a real-time mirror, not a historical copy.

---

## 🧪 Step 4: Register the Primary Node

### ✅ Command:
	
	bash
	
`repmgr -f /etc/repmgr/15/repmgr.conf primary register`

This registers the current node as the **primary server** using the `repmgr` extension.

---

## 🔍 Step 5: Verify Cluster Status

### 🛠 Command:
	
	bash
	
`repmgr cluster show`

### 📊 Output Insight:

- Shows the current node with:
    
    - `ID = 1`
        
    - `Name = node1`
        
    - `Role = primary`
        
    - `Status = running`
        
- Other details include:
    
    - `Priority`: Used for future failover ranking (lower number = lower priority)
        
    - `Timeline`: PostgreSQL timeline
        
    - `Connection`: Should show localhost
        

---

## 📌 Summary

✅ At this point:

- PostgreSQL is configured for replication.
    
- `repmgr` is set up on the master node.
    
- The master server is **registered** and **running**.
    
- The cluster is **operational**, ready to add standby nodes.

## 📚 Next Steps:

- Setup and configure **Standby Servers** in the upcoming class.
