## 📘 **Study Notes: PostgreSQL Cluster Recovery, Witness Server, and Failover Configuration**

### 👨‍🏫 **Recap of the Previous Session**

- The **main server (Node 1)** was brought down to simulate a failure.
    
- The cluster automatically promoted the **standby server (Node 2)** to **primary**.
    
- This showed how **repmgr** and **Witness** work together to maintain high availability.

### 🔁 **Restoring the Original Primary (Node 1)**

1. **Node 1 is restored** and returns to functioning properly.
    
2. **Node 2**, which was acting as primary, now needs to be demoted and returned to standby.
    
3. **Steps to Reconfigure Node 2 as Standby:**
    
    - `systemctl stop` the PostgreSQL service on Node 2 (as `root`).
        
    - **Delete the data directory** on Node 2.
        
    - **Clone** the data again from Node 1 (now acting as the main server).
        
    - **Restart PostgreSQL** and register Node 2 back as standby using:
			
			arduino
			
        `repmgr -f /etc/repmgr.conf standby register`
        
    - If registration gives an error, use the `--force` flag.
        

✅ Once done, Node 1 is the **primary**, and Node 2 is back as **standby**.

### 🔐 **Setting Up SSH for Switchover**

To perform **manual switchover between nodes**, passwordless SSH is required between all nodes:

1. **Generate SSH keys** (`ssh-keygen`) as `root` on all nodes — no password needed.
    
2. **Distribute the public key** from each node to:
    
    - `PG1`, `PG2`, `PG3`, and `Witness`.
        
    - Use `ssh-copy-id` to copy the keys.
        
3. **Optional**: Remove SSH keys from `root` after setup (security measure).
    
4. **Ensure Postgres user access**:
    
    - Copy root’s `.ssh` folder to the `postgres` user’s home.
        
    - Fix permissions using `chown -R postgres:postgres ~/.ssh`.
        

🧪 **Test SSH connectivity** between all nodes under the `postgres` user to confirm setup.

### 🔁 **Performing a Switchover (Promoting a Standby)**

You can **manually switch roles** (standby → primary) using:
	
	bash
	
`repmgr -f /etc/repmgr.conf standby switchover`

📌 This command:

- Checks current cluster state.
    
- Stops the **current primary**.
    
- Promotes the **standby** to primary.
    
- Reconfigures the previous primary as a standby.
    

#### ✅ Example:

- **Node 1 → Standby**
    
- **Node 2 → Primary**
    
	bash
	
`repmgr -f /etc/repmgr.conf standby switchover --siblings-follow`

🏁 Result:

- `Node 2` is now the **primary**.
    
- `Node 1` becomes **standby**.
    

🔄 You can **repeat this process** to switch back or promote other nodes like `PG3`.

### 🔧 **Use Case for Switchover**

- Useful for **planned maintenance** on the primary.
    
- Allows controlled promotion of other nodes.
    
- Keeps the cluster highly available with **zero downtime**.
    

---

### 🧠 **Important Takeaways**

- **Witness Server** only monitors — it does not hold data but participates in deciding failover.
    
- Always **clone and register nodes properly** after changes.
    
- **SSH setup** is critical for smooth replication and switchover.
    
- Use `cluster show` to verify current cluster state:
		
		bash
		
    `repmgr cluster show`
    
- Maintain **consistent configuration** across all nodes and check PostgreSQL & repmgr logs for issues.
    

---

### 💡 **Final Tips**

- Linux knowledge is essential: file editing, SSH, service management.
    
- All actions were done with proper role separation: `root` vs `postgres` user.
    
- Always ensure you're using the correct configuration file (`repmgr.conf`).
    
- After each major action, **verify the state** of the cluster using `psql` and `repmgr`.

### 👋 Conclusion

You've now:

- Restored the cluster after a failure.
    
- Set up secure communication between nodes.
    
- Performed **controlled role switches** between primary and standby servers.
