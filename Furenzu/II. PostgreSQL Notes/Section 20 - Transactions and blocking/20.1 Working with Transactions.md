# 📘 Study Notes: PostgreSQL Transactions & Blocks

## 👋 Welcome!

Hello to all students!  
In this class, we dove into **transactions** and **blocks** in PostgreSQL. These concepts are essential to ensure your database operates correctly and efficiently.

## 🔄 What is a Transaction?

In PostgreSQL (and any database), **a transaction is any interaction with the database**, such as:

- `SELECT` ➡️ Reading data
    
- `INSERT` ➡️ Writing data
    
- `UPDATE` ➡️ Modifying data
    
- `DELETE` ➡️ Removing data
    

Each of these is treated as an individual **transaction**. It's crucial to manage transactions carefully to **avoid performance issues** and **unexpected behaviors** in your applications.

## 🔐 Blocking & Locks

**Locks** (or blocks) play a key role in transaction management. They help ensure **data integrity** but must be configured properly to avoid:

- 🐢 Slowdowns
    
- ❌ Deadlocks or errors
    
- 🤯 Unexpected application behavior
    

Always pay attention to **locking strategies** during configuration!

## 📄 PostgreSQL Official Docs

The [official documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/) is a great reference for deeper understanding, examples, and technical explanations. Bookmark it for detailed learning!

## 🧠 Understanding Transaction Behavior

### ⚡ Simple Query = Transaction

Even running:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT now();`

is considered a **transaction**. Each call returns a **unique timestamp**, highlighting PostgreSQL's **high sensitivity** to time.

### 🧪 SELECT inside Transactions

Using `BEGIN` to start a transaction and then executing `SELECT NOW();` twice will return the **same timestamp**. Why? Because both queries belong to the **same transaction context**.
	
	sql
	
`BEGIN; SELECT NOW(); SELECT NOW(); COMMIT;`

⏰ Result: Both SELECTs return the same timestamp.

---

## ✅ Committing a Transaction

To finish a transaction and **apply changes**, use:

- `COMMIT;`
    
- `COMMIT WORK;`
    
- `END;` _(also equivalent to COMMIT)_
    

---

## ❌ Rolling Back

If something goes wrong:

- 🛑 Use `ROLLBACK;` to **undo** the transaction
    
- 🧹 It will cancel all changes made during that transaction
    

Example:
	
	sql
	
`BEGIN; SELECT 1/0;  -- ❌ Error: Division by zero ROLLBACK;`

Even if you try `COMMIT` after an error, PostgreSQL **will not allow it**. It enforces:

> "No errors allowed in a transaction."

This is different from databases like **MySQL or MariaDB**, which may still try to commit despite errors.

---

## 📖 Read-Only Transactions

You can start **read-only transactions** using:
	
	sql
	
`BEGIN READ ONLY;`

These are useful when you:

- 🧐 Only need to **view** data (not modify it)
    
- 🔄 Want to **reuse** the same settings across multiple reads
    
- 🚀 Reduce server round-trips and improve performance
    

After a `COMMIT`, a new read-only transaction can start automatically with the same properties.

---

## ⚠️ Transaction Errors

If an error occurs mid-transaction, PostgreSQL:

- ❌ Flags the transaction as failed
    
- 🛑 Blocks further commands
    
- ✅ Forces a `ROLLBACK`
    

Example:
	
	sql
	
`BEGIN; SELECT 1/0;  -- ❌ Error SELECT 1;    -- 🚫 Won’t run COMMIT;      -- ❌ Ignored, transaction is rolled back`

PostgreSQL is **strict** — no errors can pass through unnoticed.

---

## 🧩 Summary

- Everything in PostgreSQL is a **transaction**
    
- Use `BEGIN` and `COMMIT` to control multiple-step operations
    
- Use `ROLLBACK` to cancel on error
    
- PostgreSQL is stricter than other DBs — **no error is tolerated within a transaction**
    
- Use `READ ONLY` transactions for safe reads and improved performance
    
- Always check logs and behavior when errors occur

## 📌 Final Tips

- 🧑‍💻 Understand your Linux skills — we use many shell and SSH operations
    
- 🔧 Get comfortable with file editing and configurations
    
- 📚 Always refer to official docs when in doubt
