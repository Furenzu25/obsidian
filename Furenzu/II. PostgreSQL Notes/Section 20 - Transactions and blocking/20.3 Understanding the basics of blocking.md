## 🧠 **Study Notes: PostgreSQL Transactions & Locks (MVCC & Blocking)**

### 👋 Hello students!

Welcome to another engaging class — today we’re diving into the fundamentals of **blocking** in PostgreSQL.

---

### 🔄 **Quick Recap: Transactions**

- PostgreSQL allows multiple users to **read data at the same time** without blocking each other — this is efficient and safe.
    
- Problems arise when **reads and writes** happen **simultaneously**, which can lead to **conflicts** or inconsistent views of the data.
    

---

### 🔍 **PostgreSQL's Solution: MVCC**

- **MVCC** stands for **Multi-Version Concurrency Control**.
    
- This system allows:
    
    - Transactions to **see only committed data**.
        
    - A transaction to **not view** changes from another **uncommitted transaction**.
        
- This ensures data **consistency and isolation**, even during concurrent operations.
    
- MVCC is **not supported by all databases**, but PostgreSQL handles it well.
    

---

### 🧪 **Example: Simple Update Case**

- Imagine a table with a single row where `id = 0`.
    
- Two transactions begin:
    
    - **Transaction 1** updates `id = 1`.
        
    - **Transaction 2** reads the same row → still sees `id = 0`.
        
- Even after Transaction 1 commits, Transaction 2 **still sees the original value** because its read snapshot was taken earlier.
    

✅ This shows MVCC in action: **each transaction gets a consistent snapshot**.

---

### 💥 **Write Conflict Scenario**

Suppose you're counting visits to a website:

- Two transactions start at the same time and increment the same value:
    
    - Transaction 1: adds 1
        
    - Transaction 2: adds 1
        
- PostgreSQL ensures that **one waits for the other** to finish and commit, avoiding data loss.
    

➡️ This allows **thousands of concurrent writes** safely, as long as they don’t collide on the same exact row or key.

---

### 🚫 **Problem: Duplicate Key Insertion**

Let’s say two users try to insert the same `id = 18` at the same time:

- Both SELECT → see the value is available
    
- Both try to INSERT → **only one succeeds**, the other gets a **duplicate key violation**
    

This is where **explicit locking** becomes crucial.

---

### 🔐 **Locking in PostgreSQL**

PostgreSQL provides **8 levels of lock modes**, from **light to heavy**:

|Lock Type|Conflict Level|
|---|---|
|`ACCESS SHARE`|Lightest (minimal block)|
|`ACCESS EXCLUSIVE`|Heaviest (full block)|

🧱 Use cases:

- Use **lighter locks** like `ACCESS SHARE` for general reads
    
- **Avoid** using `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` unless absolutely necessary (it blocks all reads/writes)
    

You can see a detailed lock conflict chart on PostgreSQL’s official documentation to understand **which locks conflict with others**.

---

### 🛠️ **LOCK Syntax Example**
	
	sql
	
`BEGIN; LOCK TABLE product IN ACCESS EXCLUSIVE MODE; INSERT INTO product VALUES (...); COMMIT;`

This guarantees full control over the table, but **prevents anyone else from reading or writing** until the lock is released.

---

### 💡 **Better Practice: Row-Level Locking**

To avoid full table locks, you can lock **just one row** using a watermark strategy:

#### Example:

1. Create a watermark table with a single row (used as a counter)
    
2. Lock and update this row to generate **unique sequential numbers** (e.g., invoice numbers)
    

✅ **Only one transaction at a time** can update the watermark row  
✅ No other operations on other rows or tables are blocked

---

### 🎯 **Key Takeaways**

- PostgreSQL uses **MVCC** to isolate transactions and keep reads consistent.
    
- **Writes can conflict**, so use locking mechanisms to maintain data integrity.
    
- Use the **right lock level**:
    
    - Light for concurrent reads
        
    - Strong only when needed
        
- Implement **row-level locking strategies** to avoid full-table blocks
    
- Always **commit** your transactions to make changes visible to others
