## 📘 **Study Notes: SELECT FOR UPDATE, SHARE, and Database Locks in PostgreSQL**

### 🔐 **Understanding Data Flow and Race Conditions**

- When data is fetched from a database and processed by the system, changes may later be written back to the database.
    
- If two or more users try to update the same data simultaneously without proper locking, **data can be overwritten**, causing inconsistencies.
    
- This leads to a **race condition** — when the outcome depends on the sequence or timing of processes.
    

🔗 **Race Condition Definition**:  
A flaw where the system's behavior is unexpectedly dependent on the sequence or timing of uncontrollable events.

### 🧪 **Using `SELECT FOR UPDATE`**

- `SELECT FOR UPDATE` locks the selected rows, preventing other transactions from modifying them until the first transaction is completed with a `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`.
    

📌 **Basic Example**:

sql

CopyEdit

`BEGIN; SELECT * FROM invoices WHERE status = 'pending' FOR UPDATE; UPDATE invoices SET status = 'paid' WHERE id = 1; COMMIT;`

👆 This ensures no other transaction can modify the same invoice during the process.

### 🤔 **What Happens Without Locking?**

- Without locking, if two transactions fetch the same data and make changes, one may overwrite the other's changes — a race condition occurs.
    
- Locking prevents this by **blocking** other transactions from touching the locked rows until the current one finishes.
    

---

### ⛔ **NOWAIT & WAIT**

- `NOWAIT`: If a row is already locked, the transaction fails immediately instead of waiting.
    
- `WAIT`: The default behavior — the transaction waits until the lock is released.
    

🧪 **Scenario with `NOWAIT`**:

sql

CopyEdit

`BEGIN; SELECT * FROM seats WHERE available = true FOR UPDATE NOWAIT; -- If already locked, error is returned instantly`

---

### ⏳ **LOCK TIMEOUT**

- You can control how long a transaction should wait before timing out with:
    

sql

CopyEdit

`SET lock_timeout = '5s';  -- Wait up to 5 seconds`

This is useful in high-concurrency environments (like booking systems) to avoid indefinite blocking.

---

### ✈️ **Real-World Use Case: Seat Booking**

Imagine a system for booking airplane or cinema seats:

- Everyone tries to book at the same time.
    
- Without locking, multiple users could book the same seat.
    
- With `SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, PostgreSQL skips over already-locked rows, allowing parallel transactions to pick other available seats.
    

📌 **Example**:

sql

CopyEdit

`BEGIN; SELECT * FROM seats WHERE available = true FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED LIMIT 2; -- Each transaction gets 2 free seats, skipping locked ones COMMIT;`

✅ Efficient for handling high-demand scenarios without long waits or conflicts.

---

### 🔄 **Cascading Updates with Foreign Keys**

When working with foreign keys and updates, be cautious:

- If a parent table (like `currency`) is updated (e.g. changing an ID), it may affect a related `account` table.
    
- Use `ON UPDATE CASCADE` to ensure changes in the parent reflect correctly in child tables.
    

📌 **Example**:

sql

CopyEdit

`CREATE TABLE currency (   id INT PRIMARY KEY,   name TEXT );  CREATE TABLE account (   id INT PRIMARY KEY,   currency_id INT REFERENCES currency(id) ON UPDATE CASCADE );`

Even if only `currency` is updated, transactions locking `account` may need to **wait**, due to the foreign key constraint.

---

### 🧩 **Lock Types in PostgreSQL**

|🔐 Lock Type|🔍 Behavior|
|---|---|
|`FOR UPDATE`|Strong lock. Prevents others from updating or locking the same row.|
|`FOR SHARE`|Weaker. Multiple transactions can hold a share lock at the same time. Good for reading but not updating.|
|`SKIP LOCKED`|Skips already locked rows. Great for job queues or seat bookings.|

---

### 💡 **Important Tips**

- Test locking logic with your specific system to find the best approach.
    
- There is **no one-size-fits-all** solution — behavior varies across applications.
    
- Aim to avoid unnecessary blocking by choosing the right locking level.
    

---

### ✅ **Summary**

- `SELECT FOR UPDATE` helps prevent **race conditions** and **data conflicts**.
    
- Use `NOWAIT`, `WAIT`, `LOCK TIMEOUT`, or `SKIP LOCKED` based on your needs.
    
- Be mindful of **foreign key constraints** and cascading updates.
    
- Choose the appropriate lock (`FOR UPDATE`, `FOR SHARE`, etc.) depending on whether you're reading or writing.
