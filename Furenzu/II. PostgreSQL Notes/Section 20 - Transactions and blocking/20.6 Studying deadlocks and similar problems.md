# 🔒 Study Notes: Understanding Deadlocks in Databases

## 👋 Hello Students!

Today we’re diving into a **critical topic in database systems** — **Deadlocks**. These are common and can happen in any database engine. Let’s break it down and understand how they occur, how to recognize them, and what to do when they happen.

---

## ⚠️ What is a Deadlock?

A **deadlock** is a conflict that occurs when **two or more transactions are waiting on each other indefinitely**.

### 🧩 Example Scenario:

Imagine we have:

- 🧾 **Transaction 1** trying to update `row A`.
    
- 🧾 **Transaction 2** trying to update `row B`.
    

Now:

- Transaction 1 wants to also update `row B` (which is locked by Transaction 2).
    
- Transaction 2 wants to update `row A` (which is locked by Transaction 1).
    

🚫 Neither transaction can proceed because they’re waiting for the other to release its lock.

---

## 🔁 How It Unfolds in PostgreSQL
	
	sql
	
`-- Transaction 1 BEGIN; UPDATE table SET id = id * 10 WHERE id = 1;  -- Transaction 2 BEGIN; UPDATE table SET id = id * 10 WHERE id = 2;`

Now both transactions try to update **each other’s rows**, causing a **deadlock**.

### 💣 Result:

- PostgreSQL **detects the deadlock**.
    
- It **automatically resolves it** by **rolling back one of the transactions**.
    
- Example:
    
    - ❌ Transaction 2 gets a `ROLLBACK`.
        
    - ✅ Transaction 1 proceeds and **commits**.

## 🛠️ PostgreSQL Helps You Detect the Issue

- When a deadlock happens, PostgreSQL shows:
    
    - **Which query** caused the issue.
        
    - **Where** in the process it occurred.
        
    - The **row** or **physical location** involved.
        

You can run:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM deadlock WHERE id = 3.0.3;`

🔍 This allows you to investigate — but remember, if the row was deleted or modified, it may not be returned.

## 🧪 Deadlocks in Action (Another Scenario)

Let's say:
	
	sql
	
`-- Transaction 1 BEGIN ISOLATION LEVEL ...; SELECT * FROM table; -- returns 2 rows  -- Transaction 2 BEGIN; DELETE FROM table; -- tries to delete those 2 rows`

Even though reading is fine, the problem begins when:

- Transaction 2 tries to **delete** data that’s still being **read** or held by Transaction 1.
    

### 💥 What Happens:

- PostgreSQL **fails** the transaction due to conflict.
    
- ❗ `ROLLBACK` occurs on one transaction.
    

---

## 🧑‍💻 Practical Implications

- These issues are **common in real-world applications**.
    
- If not handled properly, they cause **failed transactions** and **poor user experience**.
    
- Applications must be prepared to handle:
    
    - 🌀 **Automatic rollbacks**
        
    - 🔁 **Retry logic**
        
    - 📉 **Transaction failures**
        

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- 🔄 **Deadlocks happen when two transactions wait on each other**.
    
- 🧠 PostgreSQL detects and resolves them automatically (by rolling one back).
    
- 📊 They’re more likely to occur with **update/delete** operations, not just `SELECT`.
    
- 🧰 Always design your applications to **handle unexpected rollbacks** gracefully.
    
- 🧐 PostgreSQL provides detailed error logs and physical row references to help debug.

## 🤝 That's It!

Now you understand:

- What deadlocks are
    
- How they occur
    
- How PostgreSQL handles them
    
- How to prepare your apps to recover from them
    

📚 Keep practicing, and be ready to write better, safer transaction logic!  
👍 Great job and see you in the next lesson!
