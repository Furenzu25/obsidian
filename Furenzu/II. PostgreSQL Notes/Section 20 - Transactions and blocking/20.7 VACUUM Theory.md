# 📚 Study Notes: VACUUM in PostgreSQL

## 🧠 Overview

In this lesson, we focused on the theory behind **VACUUM** in PostgreSQL. While we've briefly seen it before, today we took a deeper dive into how it works, why it's important, and how it's configured.

---

## 🧼 What Is VACUUM?

VACUUM is the **cleanup mechanism** in PostgreSQL. It works **asynchronously** to remove dead rows (old or deleted data) from tables.

- PostgreSQL doesn’t **overwrite data** immediately on `DELETE` or `UPDATE`. Instead, it marks the rows as **invisible** and leaves them on disk until VACUUM clears them.
    
- Even if a transaction **ROLLBACKs**, those "invisible" rows stay until VACUUM removes them.
    

---

## 🕵️‍♂️ Why Is It Important?

Without VACUUM:

- Storage would keep growing as old/dead rows pile up.
    
- Performance would degrade over time.
    
- Indexes and table scans would become inefficient.
    

So VACUUM helps:

- Free space (tracked by FSM – **Free Space Map**).
    
- Maintain query performance.
    
- Prevent table bloat.
    

---

## 🧩 How It Works

- VACUUM **scans pages** of tables to locate dead rows.
    
- It reclaims this **dead space** without necessarily reducing table file size.
    
- **Old behavior** required manual VACUUMs.
    
- **Modern PostgreSQL (v10+)** uses **AutoVACUUM**, which runs automatically.

## ⚙️ AutoVACUUM Configuration

PostgreSQL checks **every minute** if cleanup is needed, then divides the work into **three worker processes**.

### 🧱 Key Config Parameters

|Parameter|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`vacuum_cost_delay`|Time to pause between operations to reduce impact on performance|
|`autovacuum_max_workers`|Limits number of workers cleaning in parallel|
|`vacuum_freeze_min_age`|When to consider freezing transaction IDs|
|`autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor`|% of table change before triggering VACUUM|
|`autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor`|% of change before ANALYZE (stats collection)|
|`autovacuum_vacuum_threshold`|Minimum rows that must change to trigger VACUUM|
|`autovacuum_analyze_threshold`|Minimum rows that must change to trigger ANALYZE|

### Example:

If `scale_factor = 0.2` (20%) and the table has `50` rows:

- VACUUM runs if **10+ rows** changed.

## ❄️ Freeze Settings

PostgreSQL tracks **age of transactions** to prevent transaction ID wraparound (which can corrupt data).

|Parameter|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`autovacuum_freeze_max_age`|Max age of XID before VACUUM is forced|
|`vacuum_freeze_table_age`|When to start freezing a table's XIDs|
|`vacuum_multixact_freeze_min_age`|Same idea, but for multi-transaction IDs|

> These help keep track of whether a row's transaction was:
> 
> - In progress
>     
> - Committed
>     
> - Aborted
>     
> - Subtransaction
>

## 💾 Large Tables and VACUUM FULL

- `VACUUM FULL` rewrites the whole table and **locks it**. This is more aggressive and **should be used carefully**, especially for big tables.
    
- It can **block new writes**, making the system appear unresponsive to some users.
    

---

## 🔗 Wrap-up and Links

- VACUUM is **critical for health and performance** of a PostgreSQL database.
    
- Misconfigured settings can lead to **poor performance** or **data bloat**.
    
- We will explore **practical examples** of using VACUUM in the next class.

✅ **Key Takeaways**:

- VACUUM cleans up **dead rows**.
    
- It's **automatic** (but can be tuned).
    
- Settings like **scale factors and freeze age** control when it runs.
    
- Use `VACUUM FULL` cautiously.
