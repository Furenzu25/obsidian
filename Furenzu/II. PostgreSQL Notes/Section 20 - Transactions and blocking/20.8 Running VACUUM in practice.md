# 📘 **Study Notes: VACUUM in Practice – PostgreSQL**

👨‍🎓 **Students**, in this session we focused on the **practical behavior of the VACUUM command** in PostgreSQL. This is a continuation from our theoretical understanding of how PostgreSQL handles dead tuples and space management.

---

## 🧠 **Key Concept Recap:**

- **VACUUM** is a process in PostgreSQL that cleans up **dead tuples**—stale data left behind after UPDATE or DELETE operations.
    
- It **does not reduce** the physical size of a table in most cases.
    
- Reclaimed space stays within PostgreSQL's internal system and **is not returned to the OS** (file system).
    
- VACUUM works **asynchronously** in the background unless we disable it to take manual control (e.g., using `autovacuum = off`).

## 🧪 **Practical Test Summary:**

### 🧾 Step 1: Table Creation

- Created a table with **100,000 rows**.
    
- Disabled **autovacuum** to observe results without interference.
    
- Initial table size: ~**3000 KB**.
    

---

### ✏️ Step 2: Update All Rows

- Ran an `UPDATE` on all rows.
    
- **Table size increased** to ~**7000 KB**.
    
- Why? Because an update in PostgreSQL **creates new row versions**, leaving old ones as dead tuples.
    

---

### 🧹 Step 3: Manual VACUUM

- Performed a manual VACUUM.
    
- **Result:** Table size **remained unchanged** (~7000 KB).
    
- Explanation: VACUUM cleaned dead rows logically, but **space was not returned** to the OS.
    

---

### 🔄 Step 4: More Updates

- Ran additional updates and VACUUM commands.
    
- **Size increased again**, reaching ~**10,000 KB**.
    
- VACUUM still didn’t reduce the physical table size.
    

---

### 🗃️ Step 5: Analyze Row Position

- Used `ORDER BY` queries on IDs to check row distribution.
    
- Detected inconsistencies and scattered IDs—evidence of dead rows scattered in the file.
    

---

### 🗑️ Step 6: DELETE Operation

- Deleted a large chunk of rows (1,909 lines).
    
- Ran VACUUM again.
    
- **Table size dropped significantly**—this time it **freed space** back to the OS.
    

📉 **Table shrinkage was successful** because:

- A large block of dead tuples was located **at the end** of the file.
    
- PostgreSQL could truncate the file and **return disk space** to the operating system.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

✅ **VACUUM usually won’t shrink a table.**  
It cleans dead rows, but PostgreSQL doesn’t automatically release file system space unless certain conditions are met.

✅ **Only if deletions affect the end of the file**, VACUUM can return space to the OS.

✅ **Autovacuum** handles routine cleaning, but you may want to fine-tune it for performance or manually control it in large-scale operations.

✅ **OS-level space is precious.** PostgreSQL is good at recycling space internally, but not always at releasing it back to disk—unless the stars align. 🌌

✅ **End-users don’t see this.** Disk-level management is only visible and manageable by admins/devs with the right privileges.

## 🧩 Practical Advice

🔧 For real performance management:

- Monitor table size growth.
    
- Periodically run `VACUUM FULL` (but beware—it locks the table).
    
- Use PostgreSQL monitoring tools to understand vacuum stats and autovacuum behavior.

## 🫱 Summary

VACUUM is **crucial for database health**, but its behavior can be subtle and sometimes misunderstood. Don't expect VACUUM to magically reduce your disk usage. Use it wisely, observe the behavior, and tweak your strategy based on table size, update/delete frequency, and your disk space priorities.
