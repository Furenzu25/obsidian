# üìö Study Notes: Introduction to Stored Procedures & SQL Injection in PostgreSQL

üëã **Hello students!**  
Welcome to another class! Today, we dove into **stored procedures** in **PostgreSQL**, focusing on writing functions using the **PL/pgSQL** language and learning how to prevent **SQL Injection attacks**.

---

## üîß PL/pgSQL & Stored Procedures

PL/pgSQL (Procedural Language/PostgreSQL) is the **default language** for writing complex stored procedures in PostgreSQL. It allows:

- More control than plain SQL
    
- Creation of **robust and reusable functions**
    
- Use of logic like IF statements, loops, variables, etc.
    

While other procedural languages are supported, PL/pgSQL is the **most common and practical choice**.

## üõ°Ô∏è Understanding SQL Injection

**SQL Injection** is a method used by attackers to manipulate queries by injecting malicious SQL code, potentially allowing them to:

- Alter data
    
- Drop tables
    
- Expose sensitive information
    

‚û°Ô∏è Example: `DROP TABLE` can be injected via user input if not sanitized properly.

To protect our database, we need to **sanitize inputs** and **use PostgreSQL‚Äôs built-in functions** wisely.

---

## ‚úÖ Using Safe Functions to Avoid Injection

### 1. `quote_literal()`

- Escapes and wraps a string in single quotes
    
- Prevents dangerous characters from being interpreted as code
    
	sql
	
`SELECT quote_literal('Vitor');  -- Output: 'Vitor'`

> Great for handling user inputs as **safe strings**

---

### 2. `quote_ident()`

- Safely quotes **identifiers** (like column names, table names)
    
- Prevents naming conflicts or syntax issues
    
	sql
	
`SELECT quote_ident('TableName');  -- Output: "TableName"`

> Useful when dealing with **dynamic object names**, especially if they include uppercase or reserved keywords.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Formatting Queries Dynamically

PostgreSQL allows formatting dynamic queries using the `format()` function:

### Example Function with Formatting:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT format('SELECT %I FROM %I', 'column_name', 'table_name'); -- Output: SELECT "column_name" FROM "table_name"`

- `%I` for identifiers
    
- `%L` for literals (strings)
    
- `%s` for general substitution
    

### üîÅ Reusing Parameters

You can **repeat parameters** within the format:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT format('%1$s, %1$s, %2$s', 'repeat', 'unique'); -- Output: repeat, repeat, unique`

---

## ü§ñ Practical Notes on PostgreSQL Behavior

- **Table and column names are lowercase by default**
    
- If using **uppercase letters or special characters**, always quote names using `"double quotes"`
    
- Using quotes consistently is important to **avoid unexpected errors**
    

---

## ‚ùå Handling NULL Values

sql

CopyEdit

`SELECT quote_literal(NULL);  -- Output: NULL (no quotes or formatting)`

You must explicitly handle `NULL` in formatting if it's a possible input.

---

## üß† Key Takeaways

- Use **PL/pgSQL** for writing flexible and powerful stored procedures
    
- Prevent **SQL Injection** by:
    
    - Using `quote_literal()` and `quote_ident()`
        
    - Formatting queries with `format()`
        
- Be cautious with **quoted identifiers** and **null handling**
    
- These tools allow for **secure dynamic SQL** execution in PostgreSQL
