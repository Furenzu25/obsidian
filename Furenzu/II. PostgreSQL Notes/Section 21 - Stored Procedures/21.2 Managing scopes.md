# 📘 Study Notes – PostgreSQL: Variable Scope, Error Handling & Diagnostics

## ✅ Overview

In this lesson, we moved away from SQL Injection and delved into **three essential PostgreSQL topics**:

1. **Variable Scope using `DECLARE`**
    
2. **Error Handling with `BEGIN...EXCEPTION`**
    
3. **Diagnostics with `GET DIAGNOSTICS`**

## 📌 1. Variable Scope with `DECLARE`

Just like other programming languages (e.g., Python, Java), **PostgreSQL allows variable declaration** using the `DECLARE` keyword within a function.

### 🔧 Example:
	
	sql
	
`DECLARE     counter INT := 0;`

- Variables declared with `DECLARE` are **local to the function**.
    
- If not explicitly declared, a variable may default to `NULL` or cause an error when used.
    
- Important to distinguish:
    
    - `NULL` ➡️ No value
        
    - `0` ➡️ A defined numeric value

## ⚠️ 2. Error Handling with `BEGIN...EXCEPTION`

To manage runtime errors, PostgreSQL uses structured **error handling** via the `BEGIN` and `EXCEPTION` blocks.

### 💡 Typical use case:

When dividing by zero—something that is **mathematically invalid** and will throw an error.

### 🧪 Example Function:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE FUNCTION divide(a INT, b INT) RETURNS INT AS $$ BEGIN     RETURN a / b; EXCEPTION     WHEN division_by_zero THEN         RAISE NOTICE 'Cannot divide by zero!';         RETURN NULL; END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;`

### 🧠 Takeaway:

- Helps debug and catch known error types like `division_by_zero`.
    
- Essential for building **robust applications** that don't crash on unexpected user inputs or system errors.

## 🔍 3. Debugging with `GET DIAGNOSTICS`

PostgreSQL provides `GET DIAGNOSTICS` to retrieve useful context for debugging, especially **after exceptions** or during complex procedures.

### 🛠️ What it can fetch:

- Number of rows affected
    
- Specific error codes (e.g., `22012` for division by zero)
    
- Execution context info
    

### 🧪 Example Usage:
	
	sql
	
`GET DIAGNOSTICS row_count = ROW_COUNT;`

- Can be combined with error handling to gain insight into what failed and why.
    
- Super useful for logging and auditing during **debug mode**.

## 🔎 Common Error Codes

PostgreSQL has **many predefined error codes** you can handle. Examples:

- `22012`: Division by zero
    
- `08006`: Connection failure
    
- `23505`: Unique violation
    

💡 Refer to the [official PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/errcodes-appendix.html) for the full list of error codes.

## ✅ Summary

🔁 In this class, we:

- Used **`DECLARE`** to define local variables inside functions 🧮
    
- Managed exceptions gracefully using **`BEGIN...EXCEPTION`** 🧯
    
- Inspected error details and line counts with **`GET DIAGNOSTICS`** 🔬
    

These are **powerful tools** for writing secure, efficient, and maintainable PostgreSQL functions!
