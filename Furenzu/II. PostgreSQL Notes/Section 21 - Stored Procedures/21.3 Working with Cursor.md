# 🧠 Study Notes: PostgreSQL Cursors Explained

## 🎯 What are Cursors?

Cursors in PostgreSQL are used to **process large result sets efficiently**. Instead of retrieving all rows from a query at once, a cursor fetches the data **incrementally**—this avoids overloading memory when dealing with **millions or billions of rows**.

Think of a cursor like a scroll through data: it lets you **fetch a few rows at a time**, process them, and move on.

## ⚙️ Why Use Cursors?

- 🚀 PostgreSQL normally returns full result sets immediately to the application.
    
- 🧠 For **large datasets**, this can consume excessive memory and cause performance issues.
    
- ✅ Using cursors allows **chunk-wise data retrieval**, which keeps memory usage optimized.

## 🛠️ Creating and Using a Cursor: Simple Example

sql

CopyEdit

`CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION c() RETURNS SETOF INTEGER AS $$ DECLARE   i INTEGER := 1; BEGIN   LOOP     EXIT WHEN i > 10;     RETURN NEXT i;     i := i + 1;   END LOOP;   RETURN; END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;`

### 🔍 Explanation:

- `RETURN NEXT`: sends a single row to the result set.
    
- `LOOP ... END LOOP`: iterates through values.
    
- `RETURN`: signals the function has finished.
    

✅ Test with:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM c();`

## 💡 Behavior Insight:

PostgreSQL **optimizes by default** to only produce **initial rows** (about 10%) until more are needed. This behavior avoids memory spikes.

---

## 🏛️ Explicit Cursor Declaration (Inspired by Oracle)

Here’s a more detailed way to work with cursors, using explicit `DECLARE`, `OPEN`, `FETCH`, and `CLOSE`:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION cursor_example() RETURNS VOID AS $$ DECLARE   rec RECORD;   cur CURSOR FOR SELECT * FROM my_table; BEGIN   OPEN cur;   LOOP     FETCH cur INTO rec;     EXIT WHEN NOT FOUND;     -- Process rec here   END LOOP;   CLOSE cur; END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;`

### ✅ Key Points:

- Cursor is declared, opened, used inside a loop, and closed.
    
- Mimics **Oracle-style cursor handling**.
    
- Gives more control, especially for **step-by-step debugging or conditional logic**.

## 📥 Cursors with Parameters

You can pass parameters to functions that generate cursor-based results dynamically:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION cursor_param_example(limit_val INTEGER) RETURNS SETOF INTEGER AS $$ DECLARE   i INTEGER := 1; BEGIN   LOOP     EXIT WHEN i > limit_val;     RETURN NEXT i;     i := i + 1;   END LOOP;   RETURN; END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;`

👆 Use this if you want the cursor to behave differently based on user input or dynamic criteria.

## 🧾 Return a Cursor Directly

Postgres also supports returning an **open cursor** from a function:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION open_cursor() RETURNS REFCURSOR AS $$ DECLARE   cur REFCURSOR; BEGIN   OPEN cur FOR SELECT * FROM my_table;   RETURN cur; END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;`

Then, from the SQL shell:
	
	sql
	
`BEGIN; SELECT open_cursor(); FETCH ALL FROM "<returned_cursor_name>"; COMMIT;`

🔁 Works like a transaction block. You start the transaction, open and use the cursor, then commit.

## 🚨 Caution: Be Memory-Wise!

💡 When working with **huge data**, always be careful:

- Don't process massive functions without proper memory controls.
    
- Cursors are **efficient** and **lazy**—they only load what is needed.
    
- Avoid loading everything into memory when it's not required.
    

---

## 🤗 Final Thoughts

Cursors in PostgreSQL are **powerful tools** when working with large datasets. Use them wisely to:

- Enhance performance.
    
- Avoid memory overflows.
    
- Write maintainable and efficient PL/pgSQL code.
