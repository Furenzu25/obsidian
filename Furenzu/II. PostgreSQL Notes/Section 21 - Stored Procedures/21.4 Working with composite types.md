# 🧠 Study Notes: Composite Types in PostgreSQL

## 🧩 What Are Composite Types?

In PostgreSQL, unlike simpler databases that only support **primitive types** (like `INTEGER`, `NUMERIC`, `VARCHAR`), you can define and use **composite types**—custom data structures that group multiple fields together into a single, reusable type.

Think of it as creating your own mini "record" or "object" inside the database.

---

## 🚀 Why Are Composite Types Useful?

✅ **Flexibility**: You’re not restricted to basic data types—you can **combine multiple fields** into one.

✅ **Advanced Structure**: Allows you to design **cleaner, more structured data**—like working with JSON or structs.

✅ **Better Readability**: Especially helpful when writing **functions** or working with **complex queries**.

## 🛠️ How To Use Composite Types in PostgreSQL

### 1. 🏗️ Create a Custom Type

You can define a custom type using `CREATE TYPE`:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TYPE full_name AS (   first_name VARCHAR,   last_name  VARCHAR );`

This creates a **composite structure** with two fields: `first_name` and `last_name`.

---

### 2. 📦 Use the Type in a Function

You can now create a function that **returns** this type:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_name() RETURNS full_name AS $$ DECLARE   result full_name; BEGIN   result.first_name := 'John';   result.last_name := 'Doe';   RETURN result; END; $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;`

🎯 When you call this function, it returns the full name as a structured result—like a mini object.

---

### 3. 🧪 Accessing Composite Values

When dealing with a composite return, you can access fields like:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT (get_name()).first_name;`

📌 Just like accessing properties of an object in programming!

---

### 4. 🌈 Combine With Other Data Structures

You can even:

- Use composite types **inside arrays**
    
- Use them in `SELECT` queries
    
- Return them from more **complex joins or nested functions**
    

Example:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT ROW('Apple', 100)::product_type;`

This casts a row to your custom type.

---

## 📚 Important Tips

- PostgreSQL has **no restriction** on using primitive, composite, or even custom-defined data types together.
    
- If needed, you can extend PostgreSQL with **additional extensions** to work with even more advanced data types.
    
- 📖 Always refer to the **official documentation** for deeper use cases and best practices.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Composite types are a **powerful feature in PostgreSQL** that allow you to create more organized and dynamic schemas. They:

- ✨ Help modularize your data
    
- ✨ Improve query clarity
    
- ✨ Work seamlessly with functions and complex logic
    

🔧 If you're designing a flexible and scalable database, **composite types are your friend**.
