# 📘 Study Notes: PostgreSQL `PROCEDURE` and Transactions

## 👋 Hello everybody!

In today's lesson, we explored a powerful feature in PostgreSQL — the **`PROCEDURE`** command. This complements what we already know about **user-defined functions**, but with an essential difference: **procedures can handle transactions** like `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK`, which traditional functions can't do.

---

## ❓ Why Use `PROCEDURE`?

- Functions in PostgreSQL are great but have **limitations**.
    
- ❌ **Functions cannot execute transactional commands** like `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`.
    
- ✅ **Procedures**, introduced in **PostgreSQL version 11**, allow transactions inside their body.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

|🔹 Feature|🔍 Description|
|---|---|
|`PROCEDURE`|A block of PL/pgSQL code that supports transactional operations|
|`CALL`|The command used to execute a procedure|
|`BEGIN` / `COMMIT`|Used to define and finalize a transaction block inside a procedure|
|`UPDATE`|SQL command to adjust values in a table, like transferring money between accounts|

## ✍️ Basic Syntax of a Procedure
	
	sql
	
`CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE procedure_name(parameters) LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$ BEGIN    -- transactional logic here END; $$;`

✔️ Very similar to the `FUNCTION` syntax  
✔️ Requires `LANGUAGE plpgsql` to define procedural logic

## 🏦 Real Example: Bank Transfer Simulation

### Step 1: Create a Table
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE accounts (     id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,     name TEXT,     balance NUMERIC );`

### Step 2: Insert Sample Data
	
	sql
	
`INSERT INTO accounts (name, balance) VALUES ('Bob', 10000), ('Alice', 10000);`

✅ Now Bob and Alice each have a balance of 10,000.

### Step 3: Create the `transfer` Procedure
	
	sql
	
`CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE transfer(sender INT, receiver INT, amount NUMERIC) LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$ BEGIN     -- Subtract from sender     UPDATE accounts     SET balance = balance - amount     WHERE id = sender;      -- Add to receiver     UPDATE accounts     SET balance = balance + amount     WHERE id = receiver;      COMMIT; END; $$;`

💡 This procedure:

- Deducts the amount from the **sender**
    
- Adds it to the **receiver**
    
- Commits the transaction to make it final

## ▶️ How to Call the Procedure
	
	sql
	
`CALL transfer(1, 2, 1000);`

📌 This will:

- Transfer $1000 from user with ID 1 to user with ID 2
    

✅ You can confirm the result by running:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM accounts;`

🪙 Balances will reflect the new state after the transaction.

---

## 🔍 Observations

- Every account has a unique `ID`.
    
- You can call the procedure multiple times with different values.
    
- `PROCEDURE` is highly useful for banking systems, billing systems, or any task requiring **transaction control**.

## 🔗 Documentation & Further Reading

📄 PostgreSQL Official Docs: [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/sql-createprocedure.html](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/sql-createprocedure.html)

It's a **relatively new feature** (added in version 11) but extremely useful in practical applications.

---

## ✅ Summary

- Use **`PROCEDURE`** when you need to control **transactions** within your database logic.
    
- It behaves like a function but with enhanced capabilities (e.g., `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`).
    
- You invoke it using the `CALL` keyword.
    
- Perfect for real-world scenarios like **transferring balances** between users.
