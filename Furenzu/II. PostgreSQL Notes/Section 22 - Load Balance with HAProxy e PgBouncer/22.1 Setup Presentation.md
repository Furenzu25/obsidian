# 📘 Study Notes: Intro to Load Balancing in PostgreSQL with Proxy & PG Bouncer

👋 **Hello, students!**

Welcome to another **introductory class** — this one is _especially important_ because we’re entering a more **advanced and professional setup** using **PostgreSQL** in _critical environments_. Let’s dive in!

---

## 🌐 Traditional vs Advanced Database Setups

### ✅ **Simple Setup (Traditional)**

Most systems you’ve seen so far use just **one single database** to handle:

- Web applications
    
- Desktop systems
    
- Client interactions via the internet
    

This setup works fine for small-scale or non-critical systems.

---

### ⚠️ **Why We Need a More Complex Setup**

As systems scale up — more users, more transactions — we need a **reliable, high-performance setup** that:

- Handles **many simultaneous connections**
    
- Minimizes downtime
    
- Offers **load balancing**
    
- Uses **multiple database servers** (2, 3, 4 or more)
    

---

## 🛠️ The Tools We’ll Use

We're going to set up a **load-balanced PostgreSQL environment** using two key tools:

### 🔁 **1. Proxy (Pgpool or similar)**

- A widely-used tool for **high availability** and **connection routing**
    
- Offers **free and paid versions**
    
- Trusted by major companies
    
- Robust and production-ready
    
- 📄 Documentation and snapshots available on GitHub
    

---

### 🧱 **2. PG Bouncer**

- A lightweight yet powerful **connection pooler**
    
- Designed to reduce the load on PostgreSQL servers
    
- Easy to configure
    
- Constantly updated
    
- Backed by an active open-source community
    
- 📄 Configuration guides also on GitHub
    

---

## 💻 Platform & Environment

Our setup will be done on **Linux** (preferred for better performance).  
Windows is also possible, but:

- Linux has better performance for database servers
    
- More reliable for server-grade operations
    

---

## 🖥️ Virtual Setup: 4 Machines

We'll simulate a multi-server environment using **VirtualBox**.  
You can clone VMs, but make sure your real machine has the power to handle them all.

### 🖧 Setup Overview:

|Machine|Role|
|---|---|
|🧩 PGH1|First Database (slave)|
|🧩 PGH2|Second Database (slave)|
|🧩 PGH3|Third Database (slave)|
|🌐 PGProxy|Proxy / Load Balancer|

> ⚙️ All of these work together to simulate **load balancing** across three PostgreSQL instances.

## ✅ What You’ll Learn Next

- How to **configure** each of these machines
    
- How the **proxy routes** traffic to each database
    
- How to achieve **high availability**
    
- How to set up **connection pools**
    
- How to monitor and optimize your system
    

---

## 🚀 Summary

- We’re moving from a **simple** to a **high-availability**, multi-server PostgreSQL setup.
    
- You’ll work with:
    
    - **Proxy** tools for traffic routing
        
    - **PG Bouncer** for pooling and efficiency
        
- You’ll use **4 virtual machines** (3 databases + 1 proxy).
    
- All setup and performance tests will be done on **Linux**.
    
- Next class will dive into the **practical configuration**.
