## 🐘 PG Bouncer Installation & Configuration — Study Notes

### 🛠 What is PG Bouncer?

PG Bouncer is a lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL. It was created around 2007 and serves to **optimize database connections** by handling them more efficiently—especially under heavy workloads.

It acts like a **proxy**, managing connections in the order they arrive rather than allowing multiple direct queries to the database, reducing overhead and improving performance. 💡

### 🚀 Step-by-Step Installation & Setup

#### 🔧 1. **Install PG Bouncer**

- On the server (pg1), run:
	    
	    bash
		
    `sudo apt install pgbouncer`
    
- Change directory permissions to ensure PG Bouncer has full access:
	    
	    bash
	    
    `chown -R postgres:postgres /var/run/postgresql`
    

#### 👤 2. **Create Monitoring User**

- This user helps with system checks and resource monitoring.
	    
	    sql
		
    `CREATE USER check WITH PASSWORD 'yourpassword'; CREATE USER bouncer WITH PASSWORD 'yourpassword';`
    

#### 🔁 3. **Enable PG Bouncer on Boot**

- Use `systemctl` to enable and reload PG Bouncer:
		
		bash
		
    `sudo systemctl enable pgbouncer sudo systemctl restart pgbouncer`

### 📁 User Authentication Setup

#### 📌 Create a `userlist.txt`

- This file holds MD5-hashed passwords of all users:
	    
	    bash
		
    `pg_dumpall --globals-only > /tmp/userlist.txt cp /tmp/userlist.txt /etc/pgbouncer/userlist.txt`
    
- Users like `pg_monitor`, `proxy`, or `check` may appear with no passwords (used for checking status).

### ⚙️ Main PG Bouncer Configuration

Edit `/etc/pgbouncer/pgbouncer.ini`:

#### 🎯 General Settings:

- Allow access to all databases:
	    
	    csharp
	    
    `[databases] * = host=127.0.0.1 port=5432`
    
- Accept all IP addresses:
	    
	    ini
		
    `listen_addr = *`
    

#### 👥 Connection Settings:

- Admin users:
		
		ini
		
    `admin_users = postgres`
    
- Max clients:
	    
	    ini
		
    `max_client_conn = 1000`
    
- Pool configuration:
	    
	    ini
		
    `default_pool_size = 25 reserve_pool_size = 5`
    

These define how many connections each user/database can have **before queuing starts**.

---

### 🔒 Authentication

- Set to use MD5 for security:
	    
	    ini
		
    `auth_type = md5 auth_file = /etc/pgbouncer/userlist.txt`
    

---

### 🔃 Restart Service

Once everything is configured:
	
	bash
	
`sudo systemctl restart pgbouncer`

---

### 📈 Monitoring & Status Commands

When connected to PG Bouncer, you can run:

- `SHOW DATABASES;` – View current databases being managed.
    
- `SHOW CLIENTS;` – View active clients and connections.
    
- `SHOW SERVERS;` – View backend server activity.
    
- `SHOW POOLS;` – See user/database pool status (active, idle, waiting).
    
- `SHOW STATS;` – General stats like query count, connections sent/received.
    

These help monitor system health and detect connection overloads.

---

### 🌐 Port Change for Proxy

After installing PG Bouncer, PostgreSQL now listens on **port 6432** (default for PG Bouncer) instead of 5432.

👉 Don’t forget to update your **HAProxy** configuration to reflect the new port:
	
	bash
	
`sudo nano /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg # Change port from 5432 to 6432`

Then restart HAProxy:
	
	bash
	
`sudo systemctl restart haproxy`

Check for logs to confirm it's working properly:

- Look for `workers` and no errors.
    

---

### ✅ Final Checks

- PG Bouncer and HAProxy should now be connected and functioning.
    
- Run connection tests to ensure Postgres is accessible via the new proxy port.
    
- Your application should now point to port `6432` for optimized pooling! 🔄

### 🧠 Key Takeaways

- PG Bouncer improves **Postgres performance** by managing client connections smartly.
    
- Uses **MD5 authentication** and requires a `userlist.txt`.
    
- Each user can be limited to a pool size (e.g., 25 connections).
    
- Use commands like `SHOW POOLS`, `SHOW CLIENTS`, and `SHOW STATS` to monitor usage.
    
- Always adjust your **proxy port** and test connections after setup.
