# 🧠 **Study Notes: Advanced Cluster Setup with Postgres, Zabbix & HAProxy**

---

## 👋 Welcome!

Hello, students!  
This is an **introductory lecture** to a **series of advanced classes** focused on setting up a **redundant cluster infrastructure** using:

- 🐘 **PostgreSQL**
    
- 📊 **Zabbix**
    
- 🔁 **HAProxy**
    
- ⚙️ **ETCD**
    

These lessons require **strong knowledge** of Linux, networking, Zabbix, and PostgreSQL. If you're a beginner, it's recommended to **skip this module** and return after building up the necessary skills.

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies

### 🐧 **Operating System**

- All machines will run **Rocky Linux 9**
    
- Chosen for its **stability**, **reliability**, and **robustness**—ideal for large-scale configurations
    

### 🐘 **PostgreSQL (Database)**

- Handles **high transaction rates** and **large inserts per second**
    
- We'll implement a **three-node cluster**:
    
    - `Primary`
        
    - `Replica 1`
        
    - `Replica 2`
        
- Failover mechanism ensures high availability: if the primary fails, a replica takes over automatically
    

### 📊 **Zabbix (Monitoring System)**

- New Zabbix feature: support for **dual Zabbix nodes**  
    ➤ If one node fails, the other becomes active
    
- Works with **Zabbix Proxy** for **redundancy** and **fast failover**
    
- Ideal for **critical monitoring systems** in large environments
    

### 🔁 **HAProxy**

- Provides **load balancing** and **redundancy**
    
- Ensures clients connect **quickly and reliably** to backend services
    

### ⚙️ **ETCD**

- Manages the **state of the Postgres cluster**
    
- Enables **automatic changes** in case of node failure
    
- Should be installed on **at least 3 machines** (preferably all 5 involved in the DB cluster)
    
- Enhances **reliability** and **resilience**

## 🗂️ Infrastructure Overview

### 🖥️ **Required Machines (Total: 7)**

1. **3 PostgreSQL nodes**:
    
    - Primary + 2 Replicas
        
    - Cluster managed by **Patroni**
        
2. **2 HAProxy nodes**:
    
    - Redundant load balancing layer
        
3. **2 Zabbix servers**:
    
    - Using **HA mode** for monitoring
        

✅ All machines can be **virtualized** (VirtualBox, AWS, etc.)

## ⚠️ Requirements & Recommendations

### 🧠 **Prerequisites**

- Advanced knowledge of:
    
    - Linux (command-line, system services, networking)
        
    - PostgreSQL (clusters, replication)
        
    - Zabbix (configuration, proxies, agents)
        

> ❗ These are **not beginner-friendly** classes. Commands and concepts won’t be explained from scratch.

### 💻 **Machine Specs**

- **Recommended**:
    
    - At least **4 GB RAM** and **4 CPUs** per machine
        
    - Use **SSD storage** for database machines to avoid performance issues
        
- **Disk space**: ~80 GB per machine is sufficient
    
- For cloud environments:
    
    - At least a **t2.xlarge instance** (4 CPUs, 6+ GB RAM) for DB nodes

## 🔧 Setup Summary

- 🖥️ **PostgreSQL Cluster**: 3 nodes (Primary + 2 Replicas)
    
- 🔁 **HAProxy**: 2 nodes
    
- 📊 **Zabbix**: 2 nodes with HA
    
- ⚙️ **ETCD**: Installed on 3–5 machines for max availability
    
- 💡 Install **Patroni** to manage the cluster
    
- 💾 SSD recommended for better DB performance
    
- 📶 Configure network settings properly (IP addressing, access, daemons)

## ❓ Questions?

- For doubts or assistance, use the **course forum**
    
- Make sure you have the right **background knowledge** before proceeding
    

---

## ✅ Final Reminders

- This is a **high-availability, production-ready setup**
    
- All components are **redundant** and **failover-capable**
    
- Perfect for **large, critical environments**
    
- 🧪 These lessons are hands-on: you'll build the cluster from scratch
