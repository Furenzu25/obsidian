## **Study Notes: Introduction to Basic PostgreSQL Commands**

### 🔹 Welcome & Overview

- The session focuses on **fundamental SQL commands** in PostgreSQL.
    
- These commands are essential for efficient **database management**—such as creating, navigating, and modifying databases and tables.
    
- Expect to **revisit and repeat** these commands often, as they form the foundation for more advanced operations.

### 🧩 Connecting to a Database

#### 📌 Local vs Remote Connection

- **Local SQL terminal connection**:
    
    - Not encrypted.
    - Only accessible from your own system.
- **Remote connection**:
    - Encrypted by default in PostgreSQL.
    - Requires the following parameters:
        - Hostname or IP address
        - Database name
        - Username
        - Password
            
#### Example:

**bash**

`psql -h localhost -d database_name -U username`

---
### 📚 Navigating PostgreSQL
#### 📋 Listing Databases
- Use:
    **bash**
    
    `\l`
- Displays all existing databases, their owners, and other details.
#### 🔄 Switching Between Databases
- Use the command:
    **bash**
    
    `\c database_name`
- You can use **Tab** for autocompletion.
---
### 🗂 Listing and Describing Tables

#### 📌 Show All Tables
- Command:
    **bash**
    
    `\dt`
#### 📌 View Table Structure
- Command:
    **bash**
    
    `\d table_name`
    
- Shows columns, types, constraints, etc.
---
### 📑 Schemas, Functions, Views, Users
#### 📁 List Schemas
- Command:

	**bash**
	
    `\dn`
    
- Most databases come with a default **public schema**.
    
#### 🧩 List Functions
- Command:

	**bash**
	
    `\df`
    
#### 🪟 List Views
- Command:

	**bash**
	
    `\dv`
    
#### 👥 List Users and Roles
- Command:

	**bash**
	
    `\du`
    
- Displays users, groups, permissions, and role names.

### 🕘 View Command History

#### 📜 History of Commands

- Command:
	    
		bash
	    
    `\s`
    
- Shows the last 1,000+ SQL commands used by the current user.
    

#### 💾 Save History to File
	
	bash
	
`\s filename.txt`
- File will be saved in your **Postgres user's home directory**.
- Use `pwd` and `ls` to locate and read it:
	
	bash
	
`cat filename.txt`

---

### 📝 Using Text Editors to Write SQL

#### ✏️ Editing Commands with Text Editors

- Use:
	
	**bash**
	
    `\e`

- Opens a temporary SQL file in your default Linux text editor:
    - Options include **nano** (simple) and **vim** (powerful).
- You can change the default editor using:
	
	**bash**
	
    `select-editor`
    

#### ⚙️ How It Works:

- Write a SQL command in the editor (e.g., `SELECT version();`)
    
- Save and exit.
    
- The command executes **automatically**.
    

#### 🔍 File Info:

- Temporary file is saved in `/tmp` with `.sql` extension.
    
- It's deleted after execution, but you can view it briefly using:
	
	**bash**
	
    `ls /tmp`

### 📢 Final Notes

- These are **core commands** that you’ll use throughout the course.
    
- They help you **work faster, manage better**, and **solve problems efficiently**.
    
- All these commands will be made available in a file for reference.
    
- If you have questions, use the **course forum**—it’s open to everyone.
