## üß† Study Notes: Managing Connections in PostgreSQL
### üéØ **Objective**

Learn how to **monitor and manage database connections and activities** in PostgreSQL to prevent resource overuse and maintain system stability.

---
### üìå **Why Connection Management Matters**

- Even if users don‚Äôt intentionally run heavy queries, poorly written or unexpected queries can consume a lot of **system resources**.
- On a database with **thousands of simultaneous connections**, this can significantly impact performance.
- Managing and monitoring these connections is critical to **maintain efficiency** and **avoid crashes.**
- 
---
### üõ†Ô∏è **Monitoring Active Connections**
Use the following SQL command in the PostgreSQL shell (psql):

	sql

`SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity;`

- This command shows **all active connections and queries** in the database.
    
- You‚Äôll see useful details like:
    
    - `pid` (Process ID)
        
    - `user` (Connected username)
        
    - `application_name`
        
    - `query` (What the connection is doing)
        
    - `state` (e.g., active, idle)
        

This table helps you **identify which users or queries are consuming resources**.

### üßπ **Terminating Problematic Connections**

If a connection is using too many resources or has crashed, you can terminate it using:

	sql

`SELECT pg_cancel_backend(PID); -- or SELECT pg_terminate_backend(PID);`

- `pg_cancel_backend(pid)`: Gracefully cancels the query.
    
- `pg_terminate_backend(pid)`: Forcefully ends the connection process.
    

Replace `PID` with the process ID from `pg_stat_activity`.

‚ö†Ô∏è _Use `pg_terminate_backend()` only when necessary, as it can disrupt ongoing operations._

---

### üîç **Filtering by User or Connection**

You can also filter connections by a specific user, like this:

	sql

`SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE usename = 'postgres';`

Or terminate only the connections of a specific user:

	sql

`SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pid)  FROM pg_stat_activity  WHERE usename = 'postgres' AND pid <> pg_backend_pid();`

This ensures you're not terminating your own session.

---

### üß© **Real-Life Use Cases**

- A user accidentally runs a query that uses **too many resources**.
- A query becomes **stuck or unresponsive**.
- An application or process **crashes** but remains connected.
- Admin needs to **free up system resources** quickly.
Instead of restarting the whole system or database, you can just **kill the individual problematic processes**.


---

### üîê **Security and System Stability**

Just like in operating systems (Windows or Linux), killing unresponsive processes is sometimes necessary for PostgreSQL as well. This is part of good **database hygiene**.

---
### ‚úÖ **Key Takeaways**

- Use `pg_stat_activity` to **monitor** current activity in your database.
- Use `pg_cancel_backend()` or `pg_terminate_backend()` to **stop runaway queries or crashed sessions**.
- Always review what each connection is doing before terminating it.
- Managing connections ensures **better performance** and **less downtime**.
