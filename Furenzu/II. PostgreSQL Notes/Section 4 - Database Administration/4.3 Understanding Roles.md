## 🧠 Study Notes: Roles and User Management in PostgreSQL

### 🎯 **Objective**

Understand how PostgreSQL handles **users, roles, and privileges**, and how to **create, manage, and assign permissions** using SQL commands.

---
### 📌 **PostgreSQL Doesn’t Use Traditional Users**

- Instead of the typical “user” concept, PostgreSQL uses **roles**.
    
- A **role** can function as:
    
    - A **user**
        
    - A **group**
        
    - Or **both** at the same time
        

> 🔑 Roles are PostgreSQL’s way of managing **permissions** and **access control**.

- This concept has existed since **version 8.1**, replacing the old “user” and “group” terminology.

### 🏗️ **Understanding Roles**
- A **role** defines **what someone can do** in the database — it's about permissions, not just identity.

- Roles can:
    
    - Own databases
        
    - Be assigned specific privileges
        
    - Be a member of other roles (like being part of a group)
        
    - Be assigned expiration dates
        

---
### 🛠️ **Default Setup**

- When PostgreSQL is first installed:
    
    - A **default role** named `postgres` is created.
        
    - A **default database** with the same name (`postgres`) is also created.
        
    - This role is a **superuser** (has full privileges).
        

---

### ✍️ **Creating a Role/User**

Use the `CREATE ROLE` command. Example:

	sql

`CREATE ROLE john LOGIN PASSWORD '123456';`

📝 **Tips**:

- Use **uppercase** for SQL keywords (`CREATE ROLE`)
    
- Use **lowercase** for names and passwords
    
- **Use strong passwords** (min. 8 characters, mix of upper/lowercase)
    

To create a superuser:

	sql

`CREATE ROLE vitor SUPERUSER LOGIN PASSWORD 'YourPassword';`

To set an expiration date for a role:

	sql

`CREATE ROLE user_name LOGIN PASSWORD 'password' VALID UNTIL '2025-12-31';`

---

### 🧹 **Removing a Role**

Use the `DROP ROLE` command:

	sql

`DROP ROLE john;`

⚠️ **Important**:

- You **cannot drop a role** if it owns a database or is still in use.
    
- You must **first delete the associated database** or reassign ownership before dropping the role.
    

---

### 👥 **Creating Groups and Role Inheritance**

Roles can **act as groups**, allowing multiple users to share the same permissions.

Example: Create a group and assign a user to it:

	sql
	
`CREATE ROLE group1; GRANT group1 TO john;`

> This means **John now inherits all permissions from `group1`**, except superuser rights.

---

### 🧰 **More Role Attributes**

PostgreSQL supports many additional role capabilities:

- `CREATEDB`: Can create new databases
    
- `REPLICATION`: For managing replication
    
- `BYPASSRLS`: Can bypass Row-Level Security
    
- `INHERIT`: Role can inherit privileges
    
- `LOGIN`: Enables role to log in (necessary for user accounts)
    

👉 These attributes help customize roles for specific use cases like DB clients, replication agents, or admin groups.

---

### 📚 **Best Practices**

- Avoid giving **superuser rights** unless absolutely necessary.
    
- Use **roles as groups** to manage shared permissions cleanly.
    
- Always refer to the **official PostgreSQL documentation** to fully understand all options and stay secure.

### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

- PostgreSQL manages users through **roles**, which can be standalone or grouped.
    
- Roles can **inherit permissions** from other roles (like user groups).
    
- Use SQL commands like `CREATE ROLE`, `GRANT`, and `DROP ROLE` to manage them.
    
- Never delete a role that still owns a database — clean up dependencies first.
    
- Explore advanced role attributes and practice secure role management.
