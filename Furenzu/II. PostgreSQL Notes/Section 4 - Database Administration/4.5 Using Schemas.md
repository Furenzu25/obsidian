## 🧠 Study Notes: PostgreSQL Schemas – Organizing Your Database

### 🎯 **Objective**

Learn what **schemas** are in PostgreSQL, how to create and use them to organize your database effectively, and how to manage multiple users and permissions securely.

---

### 📘 What Is a Schema?

- A **schema** is like a **folder inside a database** that holds tables, views, functions, etc.
    
- It helps **organize** objects logically within a **single database**.
    
- Objects **must have unique names within a schema**, but **can be duplicated across different schemas** in the same database.
    

---

### 🗂️ Why Use Schemas?

- Keep data well-organized (e.g., separate tables by department or function).
    
- Avoid naming conflicts across different teams or features.
    
- Control access more precisely.
    
- Facilitate better **backup**, **management**, and **security**.
    
- Useful for **multi-client** systems, where one database can house multiple clients using schemas.
    

---

### 🧱 Example Use Case

For a company like an airline:

- Schema `plan` – for flight plans
    
- Schema `personal_data` – for employee and customer personal info
    
- Schema `maintenance` – for maintenance records
    

All these schemas live **inside a single database** for that airline.

> You can imagine each schema as a **"mini-database"** within the bigger database.

---

### 🛠️ How to Work with Schemas

#### 🔹 Create a Schema

	sql

`CREATE SCHEMA my_schema;`

#### 🔹 Default Schema

If you don’t specify a schema, PostgreSQL uses the **`public`** schema by default.

---

### 👥 Managing Users and Schemas

#### 🧑‍💻 Create Separate Users (Linux + PostgreSQL)

1. **Linux Users** (for PostgreSQL authentication):
    
		bash
		
    `sudo adduser spauser sudo adduser dogcare`
    
2. **PostgreSQL Users**:
    
	  	sql
    
    `CREATE USER spauser WITH PASSWORD 'yourpassword'; CREATE USER dogcare WITH PASSWORD 'yourpassword';`
    

#### 🏛️ Create Databases per Client

	sql

`CREATE DATABASE spauser_db OWNER spauser; CREATE DATABASE dogcare_db OWNER dogcare;`

#### 🧾 Create Schemas Owned by Each User

	sql

`-- Inside spauser_db CREATE SCHEMA spa_data AUTHORIZATION spauser;  -- Inside dogcare_db CREATE SCHEMA dog_data AUTHORIZATION dogcare;`

This ensures **each user** can only access and modify **their own data**.

---

### 🔐 Permissions and Isolation

- By setting the schema **owner**, you control who can access/modify it.
    
- Each user works only within their schema, ensuring **data isolation** and **security**.
    
- If you want to share data, use the `public` schema or create **shared schemas** with controlled permissions.
    

---

### ⚠️ Important Notes

- Changing ownership or permissions doesn't affect **active connections**.
    
    - You must **restart** the session or **terminate** active connections for changes to apply.
        
- To see the current user:
    
		sql
    
    `SELECT current_user;`

### 📌 Summary of Best Practices

|Task|Command/Tip|
|---|---|
|Create Schema|`CREATE SCHEMA schema_name;`|
|Set Schema Owner|`CREATE SCHEMA schema_name AUTHORIZATION user;`|
|Create Database with Owner|`CREATE DATABASE db_name OWNER user;`|
|Default schema if unspecified|PostgreSQL uses `public`|
|Isolate user access|Create separate users and give them ownership over specific schemas/databases|
|See active connections|Use PostgreSQL monitoring tools or commands (e.g., `pg_stat_activity`)|
|Share schema data|Use `public` or manually grant access to other users|

---

### ✅ Final Thoughts

- **Schemas = logical organization tool** inside databases.
    
- Use schemas to manage **departments**, **clients**, or **extensions** within a single database.
    
- Always configure **owners** and **permissions** carefully for security.
    
- When no schema is specified, PostgreSQL uses the **`public`** schema.
    
- Read the official documentation for more advanced configurations and best practices.
