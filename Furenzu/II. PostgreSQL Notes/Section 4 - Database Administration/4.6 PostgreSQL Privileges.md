# üìò Study Notes: PostgreSQL Privileges, Permissions, and the `GRANT`/`REVOKE` Commands

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Introduction

In this session, we focused on **managing privileges (permissions)** in PostgreSQL. This is essential for **database security**, as it controls **what actions users can perform** and **what data they can access**.

---

## üîê Understanding Privileges and Permissions

### What are privileges?

- Privileges define **what a user is allowed to do** in a database.
    
- These include **reading data**, **inserting**, **updating**, **deleting**, and more.
    
- Permissions can be **broad or fine-grained**:
    
    - Given to **individual users**, **groups**, or **roles**.
        
    - Applied to **databases**, **schemas**, **tables**, or **specific commands**.
        

### Why are they important?

- They play a **key role in database security**.
    
- By controlling privileges, we can ensure:
    
    - Users see **only what they need**.
        
    - Actions like **deleting or altering data** are restricted to authorized users.

## üõ†Ô∏è The `GRANT` Command

### Purpose:

- The `GRANT` command is used to **assign privileges** to users or roles.
    

### Syntax:

	pgsql

`GRANT privilege_type ON object TO role [WITH GRANT OPTION];`

### Common privileges:

- `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `REFERENCES`, `TRIGGER`, `USAGE`, etc.
    
- `ALL PRIVILEGES` ‚Äì grants all permissions available on the object.
    

### Notes:

- `WITH GRANT OPTION` allows the user to **pass on the same privileges** to others.
    
- Some commands (e.g., `DROP`, `ALTER`) **cannot be granted**.

## üóÇÔ∏è Working with Schemas and Databases

### Schema:

- A schema helps **organize and filter access** in the database.
    
- You can **assign privileges within specific schemas**.
    

### Example setup:

1. Create a user:
    
	    sql
    
    `CREATE USER admin WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '1123456';`
    
2. Create a database and assign ownership:
    
	    sql
    
    `CREATE DATABASE mydb OWNER admin;`
    
3. Switch to the new database and create a schema:
    
	    sql
    
    `CREATE SCHEMA myschema;`
    

---

## üß© Granting Specific Privileges

### Example: Grant SELECT, REFERENCES, TRIGGER on all tables

	sql

`GRANT SELECT, REFERENCES, TRIGGER ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA myschema TO admin;`

### Granting to PUBLIC:

- The `PUBLIC` role refers to **all users in the system**.
    
- Not recommended unless you're sure, as it gives **unrestricted access**.
    

---

## üßº The `REVOKE` Command

### Purpose:

- The `REVOKE` command is used to **remove privileges** from users or roles.
    
### Syntax:

	sql

`REVOKE privilege_type ON object FROM role;`

### Use Case:

- Ensures **revocation of access** when it's no longer needed.
    
- Important for **maintaining security and data integrity**.
    

---

## üÜï Default Privileges (`ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`)

### What is it?

- A **newer PostgreSQL feature** that allows you to **define default privileges** for future objects (e.g., future tables or functions).
    

### Example: Grant SELECT and EXECUTE to all future tables and functions

	sql

`ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA myschema GRANT SELECT, EXECUTE ON TABLES TO PUBLIC;`

### Granting all privileges with grant option to a specific user:

	sql

`ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA myschema GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON TABLES TO vitor WITH GRANT OPTION;`

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Reminder

- Misconfigured privileges can lead to **unauthorized access** or **data loss**.
    
- Always **review and limit permissions** based on actual needs.
    
- Avoid granting permissions to `PUBLIC` unless absolutely necessary.
    

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

|Command|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`GRANT`|Give users access to specific features|
|`REVOKE`|Remove access previously granted|
|`ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`|Set default permissions for future objects|

## üí° Tips

- Always use **schemas** to organize and secure data access better.
    
- Use **`WITH GRANT OPTION`** only for trusted roles.
    
- Be cautious when using **`PUBLIC`**‚Äîit's system-wide.
    
- Use **`REVOKE`** as part of regular privilege audits.
