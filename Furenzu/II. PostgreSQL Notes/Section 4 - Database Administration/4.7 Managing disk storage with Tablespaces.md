## üóÉÔ∏è PostgreSQL Tablespaces ‚Äì Study Notes

### üìå What Are Tablespaces?

- **Tablespaces** are logical names that point to **physical locations** on a server‚Äôs hard drive where PostgreSQL stores data.
    
- They allow you to **organize, manage, and relocate** data storage across different disks or directories.
    
- Think of tablespaces as a way to control **where** specific database objects (like tables or databases) are saved physically.

### üß† Why Are Tablespaces Important?

- They give **flexibility** in managing data storage, especially when:
    
    - Working with large amounts of data.
        
    - Using **different types of drives** (e.g., SSDs for speed, HDDs for capacity).
        
    - Needing to **separate data** across storage devices for performance or security.
        
- They are critical in environments that prioritize **data management, disk usage, and performance optimization**.

### üíª Operating Systems and Storage

- **Linux** is preferred for managing tablespaces because of better **security, file system management**, and permission handling compared to Windows.
    
- The quality and speed of your **hard drive (SSD vs HDD)** and **OS security** directly affect PostgreSQL‚Äôs performance and safety.

### üîß Key PostgreSQL Commands

#### 1. **Create a Tablespace**

	sql

`CREATE TABLESPACE secondary LOCATION '/your/directory/path';`

- This creates a new tablespace named `secondary`.
    
- The **LOCATION** should point to a valid path on your server (in Linux: direct path; in Windows: e.g., `C:\pg_data`).
    

#### 2. **Move a Database to a Tablespace**

	sql

`ALTER DATABASE my_admin SET TABLESPACE secondary;`

- Moves the `my_admin` database to the `secondary` tablespace.
    

#### 3. **Move a Specific Table**

	sql

`ALTER TABLE table_one SET TABLESPACE secondary;`

- Must be run **inside the correct database and schema**.
    
- This command moves only the specified table.
    

#### 4. **Drop a Tablespace**

	sql

`DROP TABLESPACE secondary;`

- Deletes the specified tablespace (after moving or removing the objects inside it).

### üîç Viewing Tablespace Data

- On Linux, PostgreSQL database files are typically stored in:
    
		swift
    
    `/var/lib/postgresql/13/main/...`
    
- When a tablespace is created, you can check its folder and verify that data is stored in the correct location.
    

---

### üì¶ Use Case Examples

- Store high-priority data (e.g., financial transactions) on **faster SSDs**.
    
- Archive old tables on **external or slower drives**.
    
- Distribute database load across multiple **disks or mount points**.
    

---

### ‚úÖ Summary of Benefits

- Better **data organization**.
    
- Improved **performance** and **storage efficiency**.
    
- Greater **control** over where and how PostgreSQL stores data.
    
- Makes it easier to work with **large-scale or enterprise databases**.

### üó®Ô∏è Final Notes

- Remember to **create the directories** for tablespaces before assigning them.
    
- Always ensure proper **file permissions** when working in Linux.
    
- Tablespace configurations can greatly help in **cluster configurations** and **scaling databases**.
