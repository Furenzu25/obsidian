# 📚 PostgreSQL Database Upgrade: Study Notes

## 🧠 **Overview**

This lesson walks through how to **safely upgrade** a PostgreSQL database from one **major version** to another (e.g., from version 15 to 16), without losing data. It focuses on **major upgrades** (not minor patch versions), and includes best practices, steps, and commands.

## 🔄 **Types of Updates**

- **Minor Updates** (e.g., 15 → 15.1, 15.2):  
    Safe, automatic. Usually includes bug fixes and small improvements. No special process needed.
    
- **Major Updates** (e.g., 15 → 16, 16 → 17):  
    Require **manual intervention**. This lesson covers this process.

## ✅ **Pre-Upgrade Checklist**

Before upgrading:

1. **Check current version**:  
    Use `psql -V` or connect to the database—it shows the version immediately.
    
2. **Identify required directories**:
    
    - **Current version binaries**
        
    - **New version binaries**
        
    - **Current data directory**
        
    - **New data directory**
        

### 🔍 How to Find Directories

- Use `SHOW data_directory;` in Postgres shell to find current **data directory**.
    
- Use `locate psql` or `locate pg_upgrade` to find **binary paths**.
    
- Binaries are usually under:  
    `/usr/pgsql-15/bin/` and `/usr/pgsql-16/bin/`
    
- Data typically under:  
    `/var/lib/pgsql/15/data/` and `/var/lib/pgsql/16/data/`

## 💾 **Backup First!**

Always make a **full backup** before performing any upgrade:

- Especially important for production environments.
    
- Backup all files and configurations in a **safe, separate location**.
    
- Use tools like `pg_dump`, `pg_basebackup`, etc.
    

---

## 🧪 **Test the Existing Database**

- Create a simple table and fill it with data (e.g., 5000 records).
    
- Run `SELECT COUNT(*)` to verify the data exists.
    
- This ensures you can later verify that nothing is lost during the upgrade.

## 🛠️ **Upgrade Process Summary**

### Step 1: Install the New Version

- Ensure the **official PostgreSQL repository** is configured.
    
- Install new version:
    
		bash
	
    `sudo dnf install postgresql16-server`
    

### Step 2: Initialize New Version

- Run `initdb` using the new binary:
    
		bash
    
    `/usr/pgsql-16/bin/initdb -D /var/lib/pgsql/16/data/`
    
- Make sure you **do not delete** the old version yet.
    

### Step 3: Stop PostgreSQL Service

- Stop the current PostgreSQL daemon:
    
		bash
    
    `sudo systemctl stop postgresql-15`
    

### Step 4: Perform the Upgrade

Use the `pg_upgrade` tool:

	bash

`/usr/pgsql-16/bin/pg_upgrade \ --old-datadir=/var/lib/pgsql/15/data \ --new-datadir=/var/lib/pgsql/16/data \ --old-bindir=/usr/pgsql-15/bin \ --new-bindir=/usr/pgsql-16/bin \ --link`

> 🔗 `--link` is used to avoid duplicating data (faster upgrade).  
> ❗ If you need to keep the old data, **remove the `--link`** option and ensure enough disk space.

### Step 5: Verify Upgrade

- pg_upgrade will check:
    
    - Version compatibility
        
    - Tables and structure
        
    - Data integrity
        

If it passes, re-run the command **without `--check`** to perform the actual upgrade.

## 🧹 **Post-Upgrade Cleanup**

1. **Enable the new version's daemon**:
    
		bash
	
    `sudo systemctl enable postgresql-16 sudo systemctl start postgresql-16`
    
2. **Disable the old version's daemon** to avoid port conflicts:
    
		bash
    
    `sudo systemctl disable postgresql-15`
    
3. (Optional) **Vacuum and clean**:
    
		bash
    
    `vacuumdb --all --analyze`
    
    Or remove old cluster manually if `--link` was used and you're sure:
    
		bash
    
    `./delete_old_cluster.sh`

## 🔁 **Tips & Best Practices**

- Always **test** with a sample table before upgrading production data.
    
- Always **backup** before doing anything.
    
- Use **official repositories** only.
    
- Check **disk space** before copying or linking data.
    
- Avoid conflicts: **don’t run both Postgres versions at once** on the same port.

## 🎯 Summary

- Upgrading PostgreSQL major versions is straightforward but **must be done carefully**.
    
- Understanding where your data and binaries are is crucial.
    
- Always test, always backup.
    
- Use tools like `pg_upgrade` to perform safe and efficient upgrades.
    
- Don’t forget to clean up after successful upgrades.
