# üìö **PostgreSQL Tables ‚Äì Study Notes**

## üëã Introduction

In today‚Äôs lesson, we explored **tables in PostgreSQL**, understanding their structure, how they store data, and how to create and manage them. Tables are essential components of a relational database, organizing data in **rows and columns**, much like an Excel spreadsheet.

## üìÇ What is a Table?

- A **table** is a database object that stores data in a structured format.
    
- It is composed of **rows (records)** and **columns (fields)**.
    
- Each row represents a unique record.
    
- Each column represents a specific attribute of that record.
    

**Example**: An employee table might have:

- Rows for each employee.
    
- Columns like `ID`, `Name`, `Address`, `Phone`, `Salary`, etc.

## üßæ Types of Tables

1. **Temporary Tables**
    
    - Exist only during a session.
        
    - Visible only to the user who created them.
        
    - Good for short-term, fast operations.
        
2. **Unregistered (Unlogged) Tables**
    
    - Faster to access.
        
    - Don‚Äôt log operations like normal tables.
        
    - Suitable for caching or transient data.
        
3. **Regular (Permanent) Tables**
    
    - The most commonly used.
        
    - Persist beyond user sessions and system reboots.
        
    - Ideal for storing business-critical data.

## üîß Creating a Table

### Basic Syntax:

	sql

`CREATE TABLE logs (   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,   username VARCHAR(50),   description TEXT,   ts TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP );`

### Explanation of Columns:

- **`id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY`**
    
    - Automatically generates unique integer values.
        
    - Acts as a unique identifier (primary key).
        
- **`username VARCHAR(50)`**
    
    - Stores variable-length text, limited to 50 characters.
        
- **`description TEXT`**
    
    - Stores longer strings with no strict length limit.
        
- **`ts TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`**
    
    - Stores the date and time when the row was created.
        
    - Uses the system‚Äôs current timezone and clock.

## üõ† Data Types and Constraints

- **`SERIAL`**: Auto-increment integer values.
    
- **`VARCHAR(n)`**: Variable-length character string (with a max limit).
    
- **`TEXT`**: Unlimited length character string.
    
- **`TIMESTAMPTZ`**: Timestamp with timezone.
    

### Constraints:

- **PRIMARY KEY**: Uniquely identifies each row. No duplicate or NULL values allowed.
    
- **UNIQUE**: Ensures all values in the column are distinct.
    
- **NOT NULL**: Prevents NULL values from being inserted.

## üìÅ Viewing Table Structure

To see a table's structure:

	sql

`\d logs`

This command displays the columns, types, and constraints defined in the table.

---

## üß± Schemas

- **Schemas** organize database objects like tables.
    
- By default, tables are created in the `public` schema.
    
- You can create custom schemas to group and isolate tables.
    

**Example**:

	sql

`CREATE SCHEMA my_schema; CREATE TABLE my_schema.logs (...);`

This creates a `logs` table within `my_schema`.

---

## üß© Indexes (Brief Overview)

- **Indexes** speed up searches by allowing faster data retrieval.
    
- Similar to a book index: instead of scanning all data, PostgreSQL uses indexes to jump directly to the relevant data.
    
- By default, PostgreSQL creates an index for each primary key.
    
- We can also create:
    
    - **B-tree indexes** (default)
        
    - **Unique indexes** (e.g., for usernames or emails)
        

---

## üë§ Creating a Users Table Example:

	sql

`CREATE TABLE users (   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,   username TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,   email TEXT NOT NULL );`

- `username` and `email` are marked as **UNIQUE** and **NOT NULL**.
    
- PostgreSQL enforces uniqueness via a **unique constraint/index**.
    

---

## üîÑ Other Table Concepts (Upcoming Topics)

- **`IF NOT EXISTS`**: Prevents errors if a table already exists.
    
- **Temporary Tables**: Ideal for sessions or short-term data.
    
- **More on Indexes**: Advanced indexing strategies and types.
    

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- Tables are the foundation of relational databases in PostgreSQL.
    
- Each table has a structured layout: rows (records) and columns (fields).
    
- Use appropriate **data types** and **constraints** to ensure data integrity.
    
- Tables can be organized into **schemas**.
    
- **Indexes** optimize query performance, especially on large datasets.
    
- The `CREATE TABLE` command allows full control over table design and structure.
