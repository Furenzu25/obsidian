# üìò PostgreSQL Tables: Study Notes (Temporary Tables, IF EXISTS, and Transactions)

## 1. üìã Overview of Table Types in PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL supports several types of tables, and understanding their behavior is essential for data management.

### A. **Standard Tables**

- Created with the `CREATE TABLE` command.
    
- Store data persistently.
    
- Visible to all users unless restricted by schema or permissions.
    

### B. **Temporary Tables**

- Created using:  
    `CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_table_name (...)`
    
- Only visible during the current **session** or **transaction** (depending on creation).
    
- Useful for intermediate data processing.
    

## 2. ‚úÖ Using `IF EXISTS` and `IF NOT EXISTS`

These clauses help avoid errors when creating or deleting objects that may or may not exist.

### A. **Creating Tables with `IF NOT EXISTS`**

	sql

`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,   username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,   email TEXT NOT NULL );`

- Prevents an error if the table already exists.
    
- Commonly used in scripts, migrations, and backups.
    

### B. **Dropping Tables with `IF EXISTS`**

	sql

`DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;`

- Deletes the table **only if it exists**.
    
- Prevents errors when running cleanup scripts or reinitializing data.
    

## 3. üîÅ Transactions and Temporary Tables

### A. **What is a Transaction?**

- A **transaction** is an isolated sequence of database operations.
    
- Commands inside a transaction are not visible outside until you `COMMIT`.
    

### B. **Session vs. Transaction Scope for Temporary Tables**

|Scope|Visibility|Lifespan|
|---|---|---|
|Session|Only within the session|Until the session ends|
|Transaction|Only within the transaction|Disappears after `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`|

### C. **Creating Temp Tables in Transactions**

	sql

`BEGIN;  CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_users (   username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,   email TEXT NOT NULL );  -- View structure (still inside transaction) \d temp_users  COMMIT; -- Or ROLLBACK`

- Once committed, the table disappears.
    
- Useful for temporary processing that doesn‚Äôt need to persist data.
    

## 4. üß† Indexes and Constraints Recap

- `PRIMARY KEY`: Ensures unique, non-null values. Automatically creates a **B-tree index**.
    
- `UNIQUE`: Prevents duplicate entries in a column (can apply to usernames or emails).
    
- These constraints help with data integrity and performance during searches.
    

## 5. üí° Practical Tips

- Use `IF NOT EXISTS` to avoid duplicate creation.
    
- Use `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` to clean up safely.
    
- Temporary tables help with data that doesn't need long-term storage.
    
- Transactions allow safe experimentation‚Äîrollback if something goes wrong.

## ‚úÖ Summary

- PostgreSQL supports **temporary tables**, which are useful in session or transaction-based data handling.
    
- `IF EXISTS` and `IF NOT EXISTS` are valuable clauses to avoid script failures.
    
- Transactions isolate your operations; **temporary tables inside a transaction vanish after commit**.
    
- **Indexes**, **primary keys**, and **constraints** play a crucial role in enforcing data rules and improving performance.
