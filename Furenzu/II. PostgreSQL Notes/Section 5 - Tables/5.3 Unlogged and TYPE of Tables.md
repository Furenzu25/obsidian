# 📘 PostgreSQL Study Notes: Unlogged Tables, User-Defined Types, and Inheritance

---

## 1. 🚀 Unlogged Tables in PostgreSQL

### ❓ What Are Unlogged Tables?

- **Unlogged tables** are PostgreSQL tables **not recorded in the write-ahead log (WAL)**.
    
- As a result, they **do not persist after a server crash or restart**.
    
- Ideal for:
    
    - Temporary data
        
    - Cache-like structures
        
    - Performance-focused operations
        
- **Not suitable** for critical or permanent data.
    

### ⚠️ Key Characteristics

- Created using:
    
		sql
    
    `CREATE UNLOGGED TABLE table_name (...);`
    
- Upon **server restart**, all data in unlogged tables is **wiped**.
    
- Cannot use **GIST indexes** or certain advanced features.
    
- Offers **major performance gains (10% to 90%)**, but comes with **risk of data loss**.
    

### ✅ When to Use

- When **data can be reconstructed** or isn’t sensitive.
    
- Use in **controlled environments** (e.g., testing, reporting).
    
- Always balance performance with **data integrity and safety**.

## 2. 🛠 Creating a Custom Data Type (`CREATE TYPE`)

### 🎯 Why Use Custom Types?

- Simplifies table creation when **multiple tables share a structure**.
    
- Acts like a **template or blueprint** for other tables.
    
- Great for managing **reusable columns**, like user credentials.
    

### 🧱 Example: Creating a Basic User Type

	sql

`CREATE TYPE basic_user AS (   user TEXT,   pwd VARCHAR(10) );`

- Here, we define a custom composite type with `user` and `password` fields.
    
- Password is limited to 10 characters.

## 3. 🧬 Creating Tables Using Custom Types (Inheritance)

### 🧩 Using `OF` Clause to Create Tables from a Type

	sql

`CREATE TABLE super_user OF basic_user;`

- This creates a table with the **same structure** as `basic_user`.
    
- You can **add extra fields** (e.g., primary keys) to this table.
    

### 🧠 Benefits of Type-Based Tables

- **Inheritance-style structure** — changes to the type affect all tables based on it.
    
- Example: Add a `phone` column to the `basic_user` type, and it appears in `super_user`.
    

---

## 4. 🧪 Modifying the Type with `ALTER TYPE`

### 🔄 Global Changes via `CASCADE`

	sql

`ALTER TYPE basic_user ADD ATTRIBUTE phone VARCHAR CASCADE;`

- This command adds a `phone` column to **all dependent tables**.
    
- CASCADE ensures consistency but should be used **cautiously**.
    

### 🧼 Tips for Working with Custom Types

- **Avoid accidental breaking changes** — they impact every dependent table.
    
- Always verify what tables depend on a type before altering it.
    
- You can rename fields, remove fields, or even drop the entire type.

## 5. ✅ Summary

|Concept|Purpose/Benefit|Risk/Consideration|
|---|---|---|
|**Unlogged Tables**|Faster performance; no WAL logging|Data loss after server crash/restart|
|**Custom Types**|Reusable table structures|Affects all dependent tables globally|
|**Inheritance (`OF`)**|Automatically syncs table structure with a type|Must manage changes carefully|
|**ALTER TYPE CASCADE**|Propagates changes to all related tables|Use with caution; global structural change|

## 📚 Final Notes

- Use **unlogged tables** only when you **do not need durability**.
    
- **Custom types + OF clause** help in managing schema consistency and reduce redundancy.
    
- **ALTER TYPE CASCADE** can save time but should be handled thoughtfully to prevent unintended changes.
