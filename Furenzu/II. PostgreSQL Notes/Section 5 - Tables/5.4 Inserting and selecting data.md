# üìò Study Notes: Inserting Data into Tables in PostgreSQL

## üëã Introduction

In this class, we‚Äôre learning how to **insert data into tables** within PostgreSQL. Up until now, we‚Äôve created databases and tables, and now it‚Äôs time to **populate those tables with actual data**.

---

## üî¢ Basic Concepts

### üîπ `INSERT INTO` Command

- The `INSERT INTO` statement is used to **add new rows** to a table.
    
- You can insert:
    
    - **Single rows**
        
    - **Multiple rows**
        
    - Data from **another query**
        

### üîπ Table Used in the Example

	sql

`CREATE TABLE users (   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,   username VARCHAR UNIQUE,   email VARCHAR );`

- `id`: Auto-incremented primary key
    
- `username`: Must be unique
    
- `email`: Typically also unique (good for search)

## üõ† Inserting a Single Record

### Syntax

	sql

`INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES ('your_username', 'your_email@example.com');`

- Use **single quotes** for string values.
    
- Use **semicolon** (`;`) at the end of each SQL command.

## üîç Viewing Data

### Select All

	sql

`SELECT * FROM users;`

### Select Specific Columns

	sql

`SELECT id, username, email FROM users;`

---

## üìê Sorting Results

### Sort Alphabetically by Username

	sql

`SELECT id, username FROM users ORDER BY username;`

### Sort by ID (Numerically)

	sql

`SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY id;`

### Reverse Order (Descending)

	sql

`SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY username DESC;`

---

## ‚ûï Inserting Multiple Records at Once

### Example Table: `categories`

	sql

`CREATE TABLE categories (   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,   title VARCHAR,   description TEXT );`

### Inserting Multiple Rows

	sql

`INSERT INTO categories (title, description) VALUES    ('Apple', 'Fruit'),   ('Orange', 'Fruit'),   ('Lettuce', 'Vegetable');`

---

## üßπ Filtering Data (WHERE Clause)

### Basic Filtering

	sql

`SELECT * FROM categories WHERE description = 'Vegetable';`

### Filter by Multiple Conditions

	sql

`SELECT * FROM categories WHERE title = 'Orange' AND description = 'Fruit';`

### Sort Filtered Results

	sql

`SELECT * FROM categories WHERE description = 'Fruit' ORDER BY title DESC;`

---

## üß† Key Takeaways

- `INSERT INTO` is fundamental for populating tables.
    
- Use `SELECT` and `ORDER BY` to view and organize your data.
    
- You can filter results with `WHERE`.
    
- Insert multiple rows efficiently in a single command.
    
- Use `DESC` for descending (reverse) order in queries.

If anything is unclear, remember to:

- Refer back to your course material
    
- Use the course **forum** for questions
    
- Practice commands on your PostgreSQL environment
    

All SQL commands used in this class are **available for download** through the course resources so you can follow along.
