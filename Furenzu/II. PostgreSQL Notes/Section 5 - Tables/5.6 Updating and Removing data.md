# üìò SQL Study Notes ‚Äì Updating, Deleting, and Copying Data

## üëã Introduction

In this lesson, we learned how to **update**, **remove**, and **copy data** in SQL. We also worked with **temporary tables** for safe testing.

---

## üóÉÔ∏è Creating a Copy of a Table (Temporary Table)

### Why?

- Useful for testing code without affecting real data.
    
- Great for experimentation or development purposes.
    

### How?

	sql

`CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_categories AS SELECT * FROM categories;`

- `temp_categories` is now a **temporary copy** of the `categories` table.
    
- Temporary tables exist **only during your current session**.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Updating Data in a Table

### Update a Specific Record

To change the value of a field in a row:

	sql

`UPDATE temp_categories SET title = 'Peach' WHERE id = 4; -- formerly Lemon`

- This changes the `title` of the record with `id = 4` from "Lemon" to "Peach".
    

### Update Based on a Condition

You can also update multiple rows using a condition:

	sql

`UPDATE temp_categories SET title = 'No Title' WHERE description = 'Vegetable';`

- Changes the `title` of all rows where the `description` is "Vegetable".
    

> ‚úÖ Tip: Be precise with the `WHERE` clause to avoid unwanted updates.

---

## üóëÔ∏è Deleting Data

### Delete a Specific Record

	sql

`DELETE FROM temp_categories WHERE id = 1;`

- Removes the row with `id = 1`.

### Delete by Condition

	sql

`DELETE FROM temp_categories WHERE description IS NULL;`

- Deletes all rows where the `description` is `NULL`.
    

### Delete All Rows (Use with caution!)

	sql

`DELETE FROM temp_categories;`

- Removes **all records** from the table but keeps the table structure.
    

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Always use a `WHERE` clause unless you **really** want to delete all records.

---

## üßπ TRUNCATE Command

### What is `TRUNCATE`?

- A **faster** alternative to `DELETE` that removes **all records** from a table.
    
- Unlike `DELETE`, it **does not support WHERE** conditions.
    

### Syntax:

	sql

`TRUNCATE TABLE temp_categories;`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Use with care! `TRUNCATE` is **not reversible** and deletes all data without confirmation.

---

## üîÑ Restoring Data from Original Table

If all rows were deleted, you can **restore them** using the original table:

	sql

`INSERT INTO temp_categories SELECT * FROM categories;`

- Repopulates the temporary table with original data.

## ‚úÖ Summary

|Action|Command|Notes|
|---|---|---|
|Copy a table|`CREATE TEMP TABLE AS SELECT`|Great for safe testing|
|Update a record|`UPDATE table SET ... WHERE ...`|Use `WHERE` to specify conditions|
|Delete a record|`DELETE FROM table WHERE ...`|Avoid `DELETE` without `WHERE`|
|Truncate a table|`TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;`|Fast but no filtering; deletes everything|
|Restore data|`INSERT INTO temp SELECT * FROM`|Use if you've deleted everything accidentally|

---

## üß† Final Tips

- Always test updates and deletes on **temporary tables** first.
    
- **Never run DELETE without WHERE** unless you're sure.
    
- Use **TRUNCATE** only when you need to remove everything, and performance is a concern.
    
- Confirm column names and values **carefully**, especially with `UPDATE`.
