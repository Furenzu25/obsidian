# üìò PostgreSQL Study Notes: Introduction to Views

---

## üìç What is a View in PostgreSQL?

A **View** is a **virtual table** that results from a pre-defined SQL query. It **does not physically store data** (unless it is a _materialized view_), but it simplifies access to complex queries.

- Think of it as a **stored SELECT query**.
    
- Helps break down large or repetitive SQL commands into a reusable object.
    
- Enhances **query abstraction**, **readability**, and **security**.

## üîç Why Use Views?

- To **simplify** long and complex `SELECT` statements.
    
- To provide a **layer of abstraction** for commonly used joins and filters.
    
- To allow **non-technical users** or front-end tools to query simplified virtual tables.
    
- To **centralize logic**, making queries easier to maintain and reuse.

## üõ†Ô∏è Creating a View

**Basic Syntax:**
	
	sql
	
`CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON ... WHERE condition;`

You can use any valid `SELECT` query, including joins, aliases, CASE expressions, etc.

**Example:**
	
	sql
	
`CREATE VIEW customer_master AS SELECT   c.customer_id AS id,   c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name AS name,   a.address,   a.postal_code AS zip,   a.phone,   ci.city,   co.country,   c.email FROM customer c JOIN address a ON c.address_id = a.address_id JOIN city ci ON a.city_id = ci.city_id JOIN country co ON ci.country_id = co.country_id;`

## üß™ How It Works in Practice

### Step-by-Step Setup:

1. **Create a database** (e.g., `DVD Rental`).
    
2. **Restore a dataset** using `pg_restore`:
	    
		bash
	    
    `pg_restore -U postgres -h localhost -d dvdrental path_to_tar_file`
    
3. **Inspect available tables**:  
    Tables include `customer`, `address`, `city`, `country`, `film`, etc.
    
4. **Run a complex `SELECT`** with joins and aliases.
    
5. **Save it as a view** using `CREATE VIEW`.
    

### Querying the View:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM customer_master;`

This returns the same data as the complex `SELECT` query but in a simplified manner.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Modifying a View

### 1. **Add New Columns**

Use `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW`:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW customer_master AS SELECT   c.customer_id,   c.email,   ...`

### 2. **Rename a View**
	
	sql
	
`ALTER VIEW customer_master RENAME TO customer_master_renamed;`

## üìö Helpful View Commands

|Command|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`\dv`|List all views|
|`DROP VIEW view_name;`|Delete a view|
|`ALTER VIEW ... RENAME TO ...`|Rename an existing view|
|`CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW`|Modify a view‚Äôs definition|

## üß† Key Takeaways

- Views are a **powerful tool** for organizing complex queries.
    
- They act as **named queries**, simplifying future usage.
    
- They **do not store** data (unlike materialized views).
    
- Views can be easily modified, renamed, and queried just like regular tables.
    
- Always **refer to official documentation** for advanced features and examples.

## üìå Additional Notes

- Use aliases (`AS`) to rename columns for better readability.
    
- Use `CASE WHEN` inside views to add conditional logic.
    
- Remember: data in a view is **live** ‚Äî changes in the underlying tables are reflected immediately.
