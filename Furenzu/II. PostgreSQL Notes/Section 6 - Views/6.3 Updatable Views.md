## üß† **Study Notes: View-Level Updates in SQL**

### üìå **What Are View-Level Updates?**

In SQL, **view-level updates** refer to the ability to `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` rows via a **view**, which is a virtual table based on a SELECT query. However, not all views are **updatable**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Conditions for an Updatable View**

A view is **updatable** when:

- It is based on **a single base table** (or view) in the `FROM` clause.
    
- It does **not** use **aggregations** like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, etc.
    
- It avoids **complex clauses**, such as:
    
    - `GROUP BY`
        
    - `HAVING`
        
    - `DISTINCT`
        
    - `LIMIT`, `OFFSET`
        
    - **Joins** or **subqueries**
        
- Only columns from the base table(s) are updated.

### üß™ **Demonstration: Creating and Updating a Simple View**

1. **Create a View** to list all cities from a table with a specific country ID:
	    
		sql
	    
    `CREATE VIEW view_city_usa AS SELECT city, country_id FROM city WHERE country_id = 103;`
    
2. **Insert into the View**:
	    
		sql
	    
    `INSERT INTO view_city_usa (city, country_id) VALUES ('San Jose', 103);`
    
3. **Check if the insert worked** using:
	    
		sql
	    
    `SELECT * FROM view_city_usa ORDER BY city DESC;`
    
4. **Delete from the View**:
	    
		sql
	    
    `DELETE FROM view_city_usa WHERE city = 'San Jose';`
    

> ‚úÖ **Result**: These commands work because the view meets the updatable conditions.

---

### üîê **Using `WITH CHECK OPTION`**

This clause **restricts** inserts and updates to **only those rows that satisfy the view‚Äôs `WHERE` condition**.

#### Example:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view_city_usa AS SELECT city, country_id FROM city WHERE country_id = 103 WITH CHECK OPTION;`

- Now, trying to insert a city with `country_id = 102` **fails**, even if the table allows it.
    
- Prevents **invisible data** from being inserted via the view.

### üîÑ **CASCADED vs LOCAL `WITH CHECK OPTION`**

|Clause|Behavior|
|---|---|
|`WITH CHECK OPTION`|Default ‚Äî Equivalent to `LOCAL`|
|`WITH LOCAL CHECK OPTION`|Validates the `WHERE` condition **only** of the current view|
|`WITH CASCADED CHECK OPTION`|Validates the `WHERE` condition of the view **and all underlying views**|

#### üåü Example: Layered Views

1. View showing cities starting with "A":
    
		sql
    
    `CREATE VIEW city_a AS SELECT city, country_id FROM city WHERE city LIKE 'A%';`
    
2. View based on the above view, filtered by country:
    
		sql
    
    `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW city_a_usa AS SELECT city, country_id FROM city_a WHERE country_id = 103 WITH CASCADED CHECK OPTION;`
    

- Inserting `'Houston', 103` fails ‚Äî doesn't start with "A".
    
- Restriction is inherited and enforced **due to CASCADED** check.
    

---

### üí° **Summary of Key Points**

- Views can only be updated if they are **simple and direct**.
    
- Use `WITH CHECK OPTION` to prevent inserting data that does not meet the view's conditions.
    
- `LOCAL` vs `CASCADED` helps in managing **view hierarchies** and **data integrity**.
    
- **Always test** inserts and updates through views to ensure correctness.

### üôã **Final Tips**

- Experiment with different view structures to reinforce learning.
    
- Always validate changes with `SELECT` queries after any `INSERT` or `DELETE`.
    
- Use the course forum to ask if something doesn‚Äôt behave as expected.

üí¨ **Instructor‚Äôs Final Words**:  
That‚Äôs it for today! Hope this session clarified how updates via views work. Remember, with proper design and constraints, views can be a powerful tool for access control and data abstraction.
