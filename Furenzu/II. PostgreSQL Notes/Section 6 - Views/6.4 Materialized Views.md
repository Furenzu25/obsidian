## üìò Study Notes: Materialized Views in SQL

### üîç What is a Materialized View?

A **Materialized View** is a type of SQL view that **physically stores the result** of a query. Unlike standard views, which execute queries on the fly, materialized views store data and allow for **periodic refreshes**. This makes them especially useful for:

- **Large or complex queries**
    
- **Frequent data access needs**
    
- **Improving performance** by reducing repetitive computation
    

### üèóÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Materialized View stores query results**
    
    - You can refresh it manually or periodically using the `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` command.
        
2. **Used for performance optimization**
    
    - Ideal for large datasets or frequent read operations.
        
3. **Common in enterprise databases**
    
    - Where data is read frequently but not changed often.

### üßæ Syntax
	
	sql
	
`CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW view_name AS SELECT ... WITH [NO] DATA;`

- `WITH DATA`: Immediately loads query results into the view.
    
- `WITH NO DATA`: Creates the view structure but doesn‚Äôt load data; data must be loaded later using `REFRESH`.

### üõ†Ô∏è REFRESHING A Materialized View
	
	sql
	
`REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW view_name;`

- **Locks** the view during refresh, meaning you can't query it while it's refreshing.
    
- To **avoid locking**, use the `CONCURRENTLY` keyword along with an **index**:
	    
		
		sql
		
`REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY view_name;`

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: To use `CONCURRENTLY`, the materialized view **must have a unique index**.

### üß™ Practical Example

**Goal**: Create a view showing which film categories are rented the most.

1. **Create Materialized View with No Data**  
    This defines the structure but doesn‚Äôt load data yet.
	    
		
		sql
		
`CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW rental_by_category AS SELECT category.name, COUNT(*) AS total_sales FROM rental JOIN inventory ON rental.inventory_id = inventory.inventory_id JOIN film ON inventory.film_id = film.film_id JOIN film_category ON film.film_id = film_category.film_id JOIN category ON film_category.category_id = category.category_id GROUP BY category.name ORDER BY total_sales DESC WITH NO DATA;`

2. **Try querying the view:**
	    
		
		sql
		
`SELECT * FROM rental_by_category;`

> ‚ùå Error! No data has been loaded yet.

3. **Refresh to load data:**
	    
		
		sql
		
`REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW rental_by_category;`

> ‚úÖ Now the view can be queried successfully.

4. **Creating a Unique Index (required for concurrent refresh):**
    
	
	sql
	
`CREATE UNIQUE INDEX rental_by_category_idx ON rental_by_category (category_name);`

5. **Refresh Concurrently:**
    
	
	sql
	
`REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY rental_by_category;`

> ‚úÖ This allows querying during the refresh and is suitable for systems that need high availability.

### üßπ Dropping a Materialized View
	
	sql
	
`DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW rental_by_category;`

---

### üìö Tips & Final Notes

- Materialized views are **great for performance**, especially with heavy queries.
    
- Use them when **real-time accuracy is not critical** (because data is only up-to-date after a refresh).
    
- You can automate refreshes using **cron jobs or triggers**, depending on your system.

### üó£Ô∏è Summary

- Materialized Views store data from complex queries physically.
    
- You can **load data immediately** or **delay it** with `WITH NO DATA`.
    
- Use `REFRESH` to update the data.
    
- Add a **unique index** if you plan to use `REFRESH CONCURRENTLY`.
    
- Ideal for **read-heavy systems** and performance optimization.
