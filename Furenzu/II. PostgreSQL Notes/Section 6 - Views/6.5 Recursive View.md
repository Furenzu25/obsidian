# üìò Study Notes: Recursive Views in SQL

## üëã Introduction

In this lesson, we focus on **recursive views** in SQL. Recursive views are used to handle hierarchical or self-referential data structures‚Äîsuch as organizational charts‚Äîby enabling a query to refer to itself during execution.

---

## üîÅ What is a Recursive View?

A **recursive view** is a database view that allows recursive querying‚Äîi.e., querying data that references itself, such as:

- Employees who report to other employees
    
- Categories with subcategories
    
- Paths and hierarchies
    

It typically uses the `CREATE RECURSIVE VIEW` statement along with a **recursive CTE (Common Table Expression)** or self-joins.

---

## üß± Basic Syntax Structure
	
	sql
	
`CREATE RECURSIVE VIEW schema.view_name (column1, column2, ...) AS SELECT ... -- base case UNION [ALL] SELECT ... -- recursive part`

### Key Parts:

- **Schema** (optional): The namespace where the view belongs.
    
- **View Name**: The name of your view.
    
- **Columns**: List of column names that the view will contain.
    
- **SELECT Statements**:
    
    - One non-recursive "base case"
        
    - One or more recursive "recursive cases"

## üë®‚Äçüíº Example: Employee Hierarchy

We simulate a company structure using an `Employees` table:

### Table Structure:

|employee_id|full_name|position_id|
|---|---|---|
|1|CEO|NULL|
|2|Manager A|1|
|3|Manager B|1|
|4|Staff A|2|
|5|Staff B|2|
|...|...|...|

- The **CEO** has `position_id = NULL` (top-level)
    
- Other employees refer to their supervisor‚Äôs `employee_id` as their `position_id`.
    

### Sample Recursive Query (Without View):
	
	sql
	
`WITH RECURSIVE subordinates AS (   SELECT employee_id, full_name, position_id   FROM Employees   WHERE position_id IS NULL    UNION ALL    SELECT e.employee_id, e.full_name, e.position_id   FROM Employees e   INNER JOIN subordinates s ON e.position_id = s.employee_id ) SELECT * FROM subordinates;`

This query lists all employees starting from the CEO and drills down through the hierarchy recursively.

## üëÅÔ∏è Creating a Recursive View

You can wrap the above logic in a view:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE RECURSIVE VIEW employee_hierarchy (employee_id, full_name, position_id) AS   WITH RECURSIVE subordinates AS (     SELECT employee_id, full_name, position_id     FROM Employees     WHERE position_id IS NULL      UNION ALL      SELECT e.employee_id, e.full_name, e.position_id     FROM Employees e     INNER JOIN subordinates s ON e.position_id = s.employee_id   )   SELECT * FROM subordinates;`

Then simply run:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM employee_hierarchy;`

This returns the hierarchy structure from the top down.

---

## üîç Example Querying the View

You can look for a specific employee‚Äôs subordinates:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM employee_hierarchy WHERE employee_id = 10;`

Or view the entire hierarchy and identify levels based on nesting or sorting by ID.

---

## üß† Recursive Search with Numbers (Bonus)

You can also use recursive views to generate sequences:
	
	sql
	
`WITH RECURSIVE numbers AS (   SELECT 1 AS n   UNION ALL   SELECT n + 1 FROM numbers WHERE n < 100 ) SELECT * FROM numbers;`

Useful for:

- Generating ranges
    
- Creating time series
    
- Filling gaps in data
    

---

## üí° Additional Notes

- **INNER JOINs** are crucial when joining a recursive layer to its parent layer.
    
- Recursive views require a good understanding of joins, base cases, and recursion depth.
    
- The official documentation provides more examples (e.g., using `SELECT COUNT`, `LIMIT`, etc.).
    

---

## üó£Ô∏è Conclusion

Recursive views are powerful tools for handling complex hierarchical data. They're often used in:

- Organizational structures
    
- File systems
    
- Nested categories
    
- Any data that follows a tree-like pattern

‚úÖ **Key Takeaways:**

- Recursive views simplify querying hierarchical data.
    
- Always define a **base case** and a **recursive case**.
    
- Use recursive views with caution‚Äîunderstand how joins and conditions impact recursion.
    
- Recursive searches can also generate sequences and solve mathematical problems.
