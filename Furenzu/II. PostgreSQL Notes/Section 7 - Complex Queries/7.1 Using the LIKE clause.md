# üìò Study Notes: Using the `LIKE` Command in SQL

## üëã Introduction

In this class, we learn how to use the **`LIKE` command** in SQL, which helps **filter data based on pattern matching**. This is an extension of earlier lessons on `SELECT` and `WHERE` clauses, adding more flexibility when searching for values‚Äîespecially **text-based fields** like names or titles.

---

## üîç What is the `LIKE` Command?

- `LIKE` is used to **search for a specified pattern in a column**.
    
- It's typically applied in the `WHERE` clause of a `SELECT` statement.
    
- Commonly used with **text data**.
    

### Syntax:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE 'pattern';`

---

## üß† Wildcard Symbols

- **`%` (percent)**: Matches **zero or more characters**
    
- **`_` (underscore)**: Matches **exactly one character**
    

### Examples:

|Pattern|Meaning|Example Match|
|---|---|---|
|`'A%'`|Starts with "A"|"Apple", "Avocado"|
|`'%e'`|Ends with "e"|"Orange", "Pineapple"|
|`'%an%'`|Contains "an" anywhere|"Banana", "Mango"|
|`'__r%'`|Third character is "r"|"Grape", "Orange"|

## üìÇ Example: Querying the Categories Table

Assume we have a `categories` table. Here are a few practical examples:

### 1. Selecting by ID Greater Than:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM categories WHERE id > 2 ORDER BY title;`

- This will return all categories where `id` is greater than 2.
    
- Results are sorted alphabetically by `title`.
    

### 2. Finding Titles Starting With "A":
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM categories WHERE title LIKE 'A%';`

- Returns titles that begin with the letter **A**.
    
- `%` allows anything to follow the initial A.
    

### 3. Titles Ending With "e":
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM categories WHERE title LIKE '%e';`

### 4. Titles Containing "ll":
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM categories WHERE title LIKE '%ll%';`

- Matches titles like "Lettuce" or "Allspice".

## üî† Case Sensitivity in SQL

SQL (specifically **PostgreSQL**) is **case-sensitive** by default.

### Problem:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM categories WHERE title LIKE 'a%';`

- Will **not** return titles like "Apple" because `"A"` ‚â† `"a"`.


### Solution 1: Use `UPPER()` Function
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM categories WHERE UPPER(title) LIKE 'A%';`

- Converts all text in the `title` column to uppercase before matching.
   

### Solution 2: Use `ILIKE` (PostgreSQL)
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM categories WHERE title ILIKE 'a%';`

- `ILIKE` is the **case-insensitive version** of `LIKE` in PostgreSQL.

## ‚úÖ Summary of Best Practices

|Goal|Recommended Syntax|
|---|---|
|Case-sensitive match|`LIKE`|
|Case-insensitive match|`ILIKE` or `UPPER(...) LIKE`|
|Match start of string|`'A%'`|
|Match end of string|`'%e'`|
|Match substring|`'%an%'`|

---

## üí¨ Final Notes

- Always remember to wrap pattern values in **single quotes**.
    
- Watch out for **case sensitivity** when writing pattern matches.
    
- Using `ILIKE` is simpler and cleaner than combining `UPPER()` with `LIKE`.
    
- The `%` symbol is your best friend for flexible matching.

## üèÅ Wrap-up

That‚Äôs all for this class! You now have a solid understanding of how to use the `LIKE` and `ILIKE` commands to perform flexible, pattern-based searches in SQL.
