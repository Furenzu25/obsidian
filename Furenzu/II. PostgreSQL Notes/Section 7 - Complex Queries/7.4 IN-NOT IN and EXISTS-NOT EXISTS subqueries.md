# 📘 Study Notes: Subqueries in SQL (PostgreSQL)

## 👋 Introduction

In this lesson, we explored **subqueries** in PostgreSQL—queries written inside another query. Subqueries are enclosed in **parentheses** and are used to:

- Return **single values** or **sets of records**
    
- Perform **filtering**, **validation**, and **comparisons** inside a main query
    

---

## 🔹 What Are Subqueries?

A **subquery** (also called a **nested query**) is a query that runs within another SQL statement.

### 🧠 Example Use Cases:

- Checking if a value exists in another table
    
- Matching values across related tables
    
- Creating complex filtering conditions

## 🔸 `IN` and `NOT IN` Operators

### ✅ Purpose:

The `IN` operator is used to match a value **against a list or result set**.  
The `NOT IN` operator is the **negation**, used to **exclude** matches.

### 🔤 Syntax:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2);`

#### 🧪 Example:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM categories WHERE id IN (1, 2);`

This returns rows where the `id` is either 1 or 2.

#### ✅ `NOT IN` Example:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM categories WHERE id NOT IN (1, 2);`

Returns all rows **except** those with `id = 1` or `id = 2`.

## 🔹 Practical Subquery with `IN`

Let's say we have a `posts` table and a `categories` table. If we want to get all posts **that do not belong** to a category titled _"orange"_, we use a subquery:

### 🧪 Query:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT id, title, content, author, category FROM posts WHERE category NOT IN (   SELECT id FROM categories WHERE title = 'orange' );`

- This subquery fetches the ID(s) of categories named _"orange"_
    
- The outer query **excludes** posts with that category
    

---

## 🛠 Creating and Using the `posts` Table

To practice, we created a `posts` table with the following structure:

|Column|Type|
|---|---|
|id|SERIAL (PK)|
|title|TEXT|
|content|TEXT|
|author|INTEGER|
|category|INTEGER|
|reply_to|INTEGER|
|created_on|TIMESTAMP|
|last_edited_on|TIMESTAMP|
|editable|BOOLEAN|

### 🧪 Sample Insert:
	
	sql
	
`INSERT INTO posts (title, content, author, category) VALUES ('My Orange', 'My orange is the best orange in the world', 1, 2);`

This structure helps us simulate a real-world use case for subqueries.

---

## 🔸 `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS`

### ✅ Purpose:

Used to check whether a **subquery returns any rows**.

### 🔤 Syntax:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE EXISTS (   SELECT 1 FROM other_table WHERE condition );`

### 🔄 Equivalent `NOT EXISTS`:

Checks if **no rows** are returned from the subquery.

---

### 🧪 Example with `EXISTS`:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT id, title, content, author, category FROM posts WHERE EXISTS (   SELECT 1 FROM categories   WHERE categories.title = 'orange'   AND categories.id = posts.category );`

This returns posts **that belong to the category "orange"**.

---

### 🧪 Example with `NOT EXISTS`:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT id, title, content, author, category FROM posts WHERE NOT EXISTS (   SELECT 1 FROM categories   WHERE categories.title = 'orange'   AND categories.id = posts.category );`

This returns posts **that do not belong** to the _"orange"_ category.

---

## 🧠 Summary of Key Concepts

|Operator|Description|Use Case Example|
|---|---|---|
|`IN`|Filters values that match a list or subquery|`id IN (1, 2)`|
|`NOT IN`|Filters values **not** in a list or subquery|`id NOT IN (1, 2)`|
|`EXISTS`|Returns TRUE if subquery returns any row|Related data exists in another table|
|`NOT EXISTS`|Returns TRUE if subquery returns **no rows**|Exclude matching rows from another table|

---

## 💡 When to Use Each

- Use `IN`/`NOT IN` when filtering by **known values** or IDs returned by a subquery.
    
- Use `EXISTS`/`NOT EXISTS` when checking the **presence or absence of related rows**.
    
- All of these are essential when **joining** data across multiple tables.

## ⏭️ What’s Next?

These subquery techniques are closely related to **joins**. In the next classes, you’ll learn how to:

- **Join tables** more efficiently
    
- **Combine conditions** across related tables
    
- Write **cleaner, scalable SQL queries**
