# ðŸ“˜ Study Notes: SQL JOINs â€“ Combining Tables

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

In this lesson, we focus on the **JOIN** command in SQL, which allows you to **combine rows from two or more tables**. JOINs are essential in relational databases like PostgreSQL and are widely used in most SQL-based systems.

## ðŸ”— Types of JOINs

### 1. **CROSS JOIN**

- Produces the **Cartesian product** of two tables.
    
- Every row from the first table is combined with every row from the second.
    
- No condition is needed to link the tables.
    
- Example:
	    
		sql
	    
    `SELECT * FROM categories AS c CROSS JOIN posts AS p;`
    

### 2. **INNER JOIN**

- Returns only the **rows with matching values** in both tables.
    
- Commonly used when you want to retrieve related data between tables based on a **foreign key** relationship.
    
- Example (using JOIN syntax):
	    
		sql
	    
    `SELECT * FROM posts AS p INNER JOIN categories AS c ON p.category_id = c.id;`
    
- Equivalent using a `WHERE` clause:
	    
		sql
	    
    `SELECT * FROM posts AS p, categories AS c WHERE p.category_id = c.id;`
    

### 3. **Other JOIN Types (Not Fully Covered in This Class)**

- LEFT JOIN
    
- RIGHT JOIN
    
- FULL JOIN
    

These JOINs will be covered in later lessons.

## ðŸ“„ Tables Used in Examples

- `posts`: Contains blog or article posts.
    
- `categories`: Contains categories like "orange", "uncategorized", etc.
    
- These two tables are joined to relate a post to its category.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

### Table Aliases

- Shorten table names using aliases to make queries simpler.
	    
		sql
	    
    `FROM categories AS c FROM posts AS p`
    
- Instead of writing full table names every time, use `c` and `p` for `categories` and `posts`.
    

### Filtering with INNER JOIN

- You can filter rows during JOINs using conditions.
    
- Example: Get all posts in the "orange" category.
	    
		sql
	    
    `SELECT * FROM posts AS p INNER JOIN categories AS c ON p.category_id = c.id WHERE c.title = 'orange'`
    

### Similar Concepts

- JOINs are similar in logic to using `IN`, `EXISTS`, or filtering with `WHERE`.
    
- The advantage of JOINs is better readability and often better performance.

## âœ… Summary

- JOINs allow you to **combine information** from different tables.
    
- **CROSS JOIN** gives all combinations; **INNER JOIN** gives matching ones.
    
- Use **aliases** (like `c`, `p`) to write cleaner queries.
    
- Filtering can be done using `WHERE` or directly in the `ON` clause of JOIN.
    
- JOINs are powerful and widely used in real-world database operations.
