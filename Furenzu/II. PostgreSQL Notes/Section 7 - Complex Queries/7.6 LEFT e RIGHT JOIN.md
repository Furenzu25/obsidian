# üìò Study Notes: SQL JOINs ‚Äì LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN

## üéØ Lesson Focus

In this class, we explore **LEFT JOIN** and **RIGHT JOIN** in SQL, which are used to **combine data from two tables** with emphasis on retaining all rows from one side (left or right) of the JOIN.

---

## üîó What are LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN?

### LEFT JOIN

- **Returns all records from the left table**, and the **matched records from the right table**.
    
- If there‚Äôs **no match**, the result will contain **NULLs** for columns from the right table.
    
    üìå **Use Case:** You want to get all categories, even if some have **no related posts**.
    
    **Example Query:**
		
		sql
	    
    `SELECT c.*, p.* FROM categories AS c LEFT JOIN posts AS p ON c.id = p.category_id;`
    
    - Shows all categories.
        
    - If a category has no posts, the post columns will be `NULL`.

### RIGHT JOIN

- **Returns all records from the right table**, and the **matched records from the left table**.
    
- Works just like a LEFT JOIN, but **in reverse order**.
    
    üìå **Use Case:** If you're focusing on the second (right) table and still want to include unmatched rows from it.
    
    **Example Query:**
	    
		sql
	    
    `SELECT c.*, p.* FROM posts AS p RIGHT JOIN categories AS c ON c.id = p.category_id;`
    
    - Also returns all categories with their posts.
        
    - Has the same result as the LEFT JOIN above when you reverse the order of tables.

## ‚ùó Null Results and Filtering

If a category **does not have a post**, then:

- LEFT JOIN will still return the category, but post columns will be `NULL`.
    

### How to Filter for Categories Without Posts

#### Method 1: Using `NOT IN`
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM categories WHERE id NOT IN (SELECT category_id FROM posts);`

#### Method 2: Using `NOT EXISTS`
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM categories c WHERE NOT EXISTS (   SELECT 1 FROM posts p WHERE p.category_id = c.id );`

#### Method 3: Using `LEFT JOIN` + `IS NULL`
	
	sql
	
`SELECT c.* FROM categories c LEFT JOIN posts p ON c.id = p.category_id WHERE p.category_id IS NULL;`

- All three return **categories that don‚Äôt have any posts**.
    
- These are different syntactic approaches for the **same logical goal**.

## üß† Key Concepts

- **LEFT JOIN**: All data from the **left table**, matched data from the right. NULLs if no match.
    
- **RIGHT JOIN**: All data from the **right table**, matched data from the left. NULLs if no match.
    
- You can use **NOT IN**, **NOT EXISTS**, or **LEFT JOIN with IS NULL** to find unmatched records.
    
- **Reversing tables in LEFT JOIN** gives a **RIGHT JOIN** result, and vice versa.

## ‚úÖ Summary

|JOIN Type|Returns From Left|Returns From Right|NULLs When No Match|
|---|---|---|---|
|LEFT JOIN|‚úÖ|‚úÖ if matched|Right side = NULL|
|RIGHT JOIN|‚úÖ if matched|‚úÖ|Left side = NULL|

- Use **LEFT JOIN** to keep all records from the left table, regardless of matching.
    
- Use **RIGHT JOIN** to keep all records from the right table, regardless of matching.
    
- Filtering for **rows with no matches** is a common use case for LEFT JOIN + `IS NULL`.

## üìö Tip

Always consult the **official documentation** or practice on your own tables to better understand how JOINs work. Trying different JOIN types with real data will help solidify the concepts.
