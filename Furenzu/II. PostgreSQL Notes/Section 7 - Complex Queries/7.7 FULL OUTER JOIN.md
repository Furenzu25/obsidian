# üìò SQL Study Notes: OUTER JOIN, FULL JOIN, CROSS JOIN, and SELF JOIN

## üëã Welcome!

In this class, we explored **advanced SQL JOINs**, specifically:

- **OUTER JOINs (LEFT, RIGHT, and FULL)**
    
- **CROSS JOIN**
    
- **SELF JOIN**
    

Each allows you to combine and retrieve data from multiple tables in different ways depending on the relationships between them.

---

## üîÅ RECAP: LEFT and RIGHT JOIN (from previous lessons)

- **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all records from the left table, and matched ones from the right. Unmatched right table rows show as `NULL`.
    
- **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all records from the right table, and matched ones from the left. Unmatched left table rows show as `NULL`.
    

---

## üåê FULL OUTER JOIN

### ‚úÖ What is it?

- A **FULL OUTER JOIN** is like combining both LEFT and RIGHT JOINs.
    
- Returns **all records from both tables**.
    
- If there‚Äôs no match, `NULL` is shown in the columns of the non-matching table.
    

### üìå Example Tables Used:

1. `tags`: Contains tag information like `id`, `name`, and `parent`.
    
2. `posts_tags`: A bridge table with `tag_id` and `post_id`.
    
3. `posts`: A table of blog post entries with `title`, `author`, etc.
    

### üîç Example:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM tags FULL OUTER JOIN posts_tags ON tags.id = posts_tags.tag_id;`

This returns all tags and all posts that have those tags, **even if there's no match** on either side.

---

## üîÅ CROSS JOIN

### ‚úÖ What is it?

- A **CROSS JOIN** returns the **Cartesian product** of two tables.
    
- That means: **every row from the first table is matched with every row from the second**.
    

### ‚ùó Difference from FULL JOIN:

- **FULL OUTER JOIN** tries to match records; unmatched ones get `NULL`.
    
- **CROSS JOIN** doesn‚Äôt care about matching ‚Äì it combines **all possible row combinations**.
    

### üìå Example:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT posts.title, tags.name FROM posts CROSS JOIN tags;`

If there are 4 posts and 4 tags, you get **16 rows**.

---

## üîÅ SELF JOIN

### ‚úÖ What is it?

- A **SELF JOIN** is when a table is joined with itself.
    
- Useful when comparing rows within the same table.
    

### üìå Use Case:

Find **posts by author 2** that belong to the **same category** as posts by author 1.

#### Step-by-Step:

1. Get posts from author 1 and note their categories.
    
2. Get posts from author 2.
    
3. Join the table with itself to compare categories.
    

### üîç Query Example:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT p2.* FROM posts p1 INNER JOIN posts p2 ON p1.category_id = p2.category_id WHERE p1.author = 'Author1' AND p2.author = 'Author2';`

This finds all posts from Author2 that share a category with posts from Author1.

## üí° Tips and Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Use Table Aliases

- Makes queries shorter and easier to read.
	    
		
		sql
		
`SELECT p.title, t.name FROM posts AS p JOIN tags AS t ON p.tag_id = t.id;`

### ‚úÖ Practice JOINs with sample data

- Create small tables like `posts`, `tags`, and `posts_tags` to try LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS, and SELF JOINs.
    

### ‚úÖ Remember:

|JOIN Type|Keeps All From|Matches From|Fills with NULLs|
|---|---|---|---|
|LEFT JOIN|Left Table|Right Table|Right side|
|RIGHT JOIN|Right Table|Left Table|Left side|
|FULL OUTER JOIN|Both Tables|Each other|Both sides|
|CROSS JOIN|Neither|All Combos|None|
|SELF JOIN|One Table|Itself|As needed|

## üìå Summary

- **FULL OUTER JOIN** = LEFT JOIN + RIGHT JOIN.
    
- **CROSS JOIN** = Every combination (Cartesian product).
    
- **SELF JOIN** = Compare rows within the same table.
    
- Use **aliases** to make queries clearer.
    
- Combine these techniques to answer complex questions from your data.
