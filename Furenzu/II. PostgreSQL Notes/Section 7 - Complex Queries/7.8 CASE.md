# üìò Study Notes: Using `CASE` in SQL (PostgreSQL)

## üëã Introduction

- In this session, we‚Äôre learning about the **`CASE` expression** in SQL, specifically in **PostgreSQL**.
    
- `CASE` allows us to write **conditional logic** inside our SQL queries‚Äîsimilar to `IF...ELSE` statements in programming languages.

## üß† What is `CASE`?

- `CASE` is used to add **logic-based conditions** directly in SQL statements.
    
- You can use it inside **`SELECT`**, **`WHERE`**, **aggregate functions**, and more.
    
- Think of `CASE` as a way to label, classify, or categorize your data **on the fly**, without changing the database itself.

## üé¨ Practical Example: Categorizing Film Durations

Using the `film` table from the DVD database:

- Columns: `title`, `description`, `length` (duration in minutes)
    

**Objective:** Classify films into:

- **Short films**: Less than 50 minutes
    
- **Medium-length**: Between 50 and less than 120 minutes
    
- **Long films**: 120 minutes or more
    

**Sample Query:**
	
	sql
	
`SELECT    title,   length,   CASE     WHEN length > 0 AND length < 50 THEN 'Short'     WHEN length >= 50 AND length < 120 THEN 'Medium'     WHEN length >= 120 THEN 'Long'   END AS duration_category FROM film ORDER BY title;`

‚úÖ This query shows the **film title**, **duration**, and a new labeled column `duration_category`.

## üí∞ Example: Categorizing by Price (Rental Rates)

From the same DVD database, using the `film` table and `rental_rate` column:

- **Economical**: ‚Ç¨0.99
    
- **Popular**: ‚Ç¨2.99
    
- **Premium**: ‚Ç¨4.99
    

**Objective:** Count how many films fall into each price category.

**Sample Query:**
	
	sql
	
`SELECT    CASE     WHEN rental_rate = 0.99 THEN 'Economical'     WHEN rental_rate = 2.99 THEN 'Popular'     WHEN rental_rate = 4.99 THEN 'Premium'   END AS price_category,   COUNT(*) AS total_movies FROM film GROUP BY price_category;`

‚úÖ This query shows how many films fall into each pricing tier.

## üè∑Ô∏è Example: Labeling Film Ratings

Films have classifications (like age ratings) in a column named `rating`.

**Objective:** Provide human-readable labels for age ratings.

|Rating|Label|
|---|---|
|G|All Ages|
|PG|Parental Guidance|
|PG-13|Teens (13+)|
|R|Restricted|
|NC-17|Adults Only|

**Sample Query:**
	
		sql
	
`SELECT    title,   rating,   CASE     WHEN rating = 'G' THEN 'All Ages'     WHEN rating = 'PG' THEN 'Parental Guidance'     WHEN rating = 'PG-13' THEN 'Teens (13+)'     WHEN rating = 'R' THEN 'Restricted'     WHEN rating = 'NC-17' THEN 'Adults Only'   END AS rating_description FROM film ORDER BY title;`

‚úÖ This provides a **clearer label** for each film's classification.

## ‚ûï Using `CASE` with Aggregation

Want to **count how many movies** fall into each age rating?

**Sample Query:**
	
	sql
	
`SELECT    CASE     WHEN rating = 'G' THEN 'All Ages'     WHEN rating = 'PG' THEN 'Parental Guidance'     WHEN rating = 'PG-13' THEN 'Teens (13+)'     WHEN rating = 'R' THEN 'Restricted'     WHEN rating = 'NC-17' THEN 'Adults Only'   END AS rating_category,   COUNT(*) AS total_movies FROM film GROUP BY rating_category;`

üìä This shows how many films are in each **rating category**.

## ‚úÖ Final Takeaways

- `CASE` is an extremely powerful **conditional tool** in SQL.
    
- It allows for **dynamic categorization** and **custom labeling** of results.
    
- Works well in:
    
    - Simple `SELECT` statements
        
    - `GROUP BY` aggregations
        
    - Even inside functions like `SUM()` and `COUNT()`

## üßë‚Äçüè´ Pro Tips

- Always remember to include an `ELSE` if you want to catch any unmatched values.
    
- You don‚Äôt need to modify the database‚Äîjust use `SELECT` to show temporary results.
    
- Order results using `ORDER BY` for better readability (e.g., by `title`).
