## üìò **Study Notes: Handling NULL Values in SQL with COALESCE**

### üéØ **Objective**

To understand and apply the `COALESCE` function in SQL to handle `NULL` values effectively in queries.

---

### üîç **What is COALESCE?**

- `COALESCE()` is a **SQL function** used to handle `NULL` values.
    
- It returns the **first non-NULL value** from a list of arguments.
    
- If **all values are NULL**, it returns `NULL`.
    
- The function checks the arguments **from left to right**.
    

---

### üîÑ **COALESCE vs. Other Functions**

- **Similar to**:
    
    - `IF()` in MySQL
        
    - `NVL()` in Oracle
        
    - `CASE` expression in SQL
        
- COALESCE is **simpler and cleaner** than `CASE` for this use case.
    

---

### üß™ **Basic Usage Example**
	
	sql
	
`SELECT COALESCE(NULL, NULL, 5, 10); -- Output: 5`

- It returns `5` because it‚Äôs the **first non-null** value.
    

---

### üìÑ **Real-World Scenario: Posts Table**

- Imagine a `posts` table with columns: `title`, `author`, `content`, `category`, `reply`, `created_at`, `last_edit`.
    

#### Problem:

- Some posts might have no excerpt (NULL).
    

#### Solution:

- Show the excerpt if it exists; otherwise, show the **first 150 characters** of the `content`.
    
	
	sql
	
`SELECT COALESCE(excerpt, SUBSTRING(content FROM 1 FOR 150)) AS preview FROM posts;`

---

### üìä **Practice Example: Items Table**

Create a new table:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE items (   id SERIAL,   product TEXT,   price NUMERIC,   discount NUMERIC );`

Insert data, including some `NULL` discounts:
	
	sql
	
`INSERT INTO items (product, price, discount) VALUES ('A', 1000, 10), ('B', 1000, 25), ('C', 800, 5), ('D', 500, NULL);`

---

### ‚ùå Problem Without COALESCE
	
	sql
	
`SELECT product, price - discount AS total_price FROM items;`

- For product D (with NULL discount), this returns NULL.
    
- SQL can't subtract a number and a NULL.
    

---

### ‚úÖ Solution with COALESCE
	
	sql
	
`SELECT product, price - COALESCE(discount, 0) AS total_price FROM items;`

- If `discount` is NULL, it treats it as `0`.
    
- Now product D returns `500` as expected.
    

---

### üîÑ Alternative: Using CASE
	
	sql
	
`SELECT product,        price - CASE WHEN discount IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE discount END AS total_price FROM items;`

- Produces the **same result**.
    
- But **COALESCE is cleaner and shorter**.
    

---

### ‚úÖ **Why Prefer COALESCE?**

- **Simplifies** queries.
    
- Reduces lines of code.
    
- Easier to maintain and read.
    
- Efficient for default value handling.
    

---

### üìå **Key Takeaways**

- Use `COALESCE` to replace `NULL` values with defaults.
    
- It‚Äôs especially useful in calculations and display logic.
    
- Prefer it over `CASE` for conciseness and readability.
    
- Applicable in real-world cases like handling missing discounts, excerpts, or optional data.
