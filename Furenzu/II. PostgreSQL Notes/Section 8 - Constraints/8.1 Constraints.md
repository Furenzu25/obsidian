# ðŸ“˜ Study Notes: Understanding **Constraints** in SQL (PostgreSQL)

## ðŸ§  What Are Constraints?

**Constraints** are rules applied to database **columns** and **tables** that control the kind of data that can be inserted. They help maintain **data integrity** and **validity** by restricting or validating the values stored in a database.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Why Use Constraints?

Constraints are important because they:

- **Prevent invalid data** from being entered (e.g., negative prices).
    
- **Enforce business rules** (e.g., no duplicate product IDs).
    
- **Maintain data consistency** across tables.
    
- Automatically return an **error** when a user tries to insert or update invalid data.
    

---

## ðŸ“Œ Real-World Examples

- A product's **price** should never be negative.
    
- An **age** column should only accept **positive integers**.
    
- A **product ID** should be **unique**â€”there must be **only one row per product**.
    

Using constraints ensures your database doesn't store **bad or inconsistent data**.

## ðŸ”‘ Common Types of Constraints

Weâ€™ll explore these key constraint types throughout the course:

|Constraint|Purpose|
|---|---|
|`PRIMARY KEY`|Ensures a column (or group of columns) has **unique** and **non-null** values.|
|`UNIQUE`|Makes sure all values in a column are **unique** (but can allow `NULL`).|
|`CHECK`|Ensures values meet a **specific condition** (e.g., `price > 0`).|
|`FOREIGN KEY`|Enforces a relationship between columns in **different tables**.|
|`NOT NULL`|Prevents a column from having `NULL` values.|

---

## ðŸ”§ How Constraints Work in Practice

- You can define constraints **when creating a table** or **alter them later**.
    
- When a user tries to insert or update a record that **violates a constraint**, the database will **reject** the operation and throw an **error**.

## ðŸ“„ Official PostgreSQL Documentation

You're encouraged to explore the [official PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/) to see more examples and advanced usage of constraints. The instructor mentioned theyâ€™ll also provide a practical example in the upcoming classes.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Summary

- Constraints help **control data quality** in your database.
    
- They **automatically enforce rules** to prevent incorrect or duplicate entries.
    
- You'll commonly use constraints like **PRIMARY KEY**, **UNIQUE**, **CHECK**, and **FOREIGN KEY**.
    
- Learning constraints is **crucial** for designing **robust and secure** databases.
