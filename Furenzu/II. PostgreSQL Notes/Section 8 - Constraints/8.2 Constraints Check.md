# 📘 Study Notes: CHECK Constraints in PostgreSQL

## 👋 Introduction

In this class, we learned about the **`CHECK` constraint**, a type of **restriction** in SQL (specifically in PostgreSQL) used to ensure that the data entered into a table meets specific **conditions**.

This constraint is essential when we want to **validate column values** using **Boolean expressions** (conditions that evaluate to either `TRUE` or `FALSE`).

## ✅ What is a CHECK Constraint?

A `CHECK` constraint is used to **validate data** before it is inserted or updated in a table. It ensures that a column (or multiple columns) meets a defined logical **condition**.

### 🔹 Key Points:

- It uses **Boolean expressions** (e.g., `price > 0`).
    
- If the condition is not met, the database throws an **error** and rejects the operation.
    
- Common use cases: ensuring **positive prices**, valid **ages**, **discount rules**, and more.
    

---

## 🧪 Example 1: Enforcing Positive Prices
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE products (   product_code INT,   name TEXT,   price NUMERIC CHECK (price > 0) );`

- This ensures that the `price` column will only accept values **greater than 0**.
    
- If you try to insert a product with a negative price, PostgreSQL will return an error.
    

💡 Tip: You can **name your constraint** for better error readability:
	
	sql
	
`price NUMERIC CONSTRAINT positive_price CHECK (price > 0)`

---

## 🧪 Example 2: Discount Logic
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE products3 (   product_code INT,   name TEXT,   price NUMERIC,   discount NUMERIC,   CHECK (price > 0),   CHECK (discount < price) );`

- First check: `price > 0` (must be positive).
    
- Second check: `discount < price` (discount must be less than the original price).
    

If a user tries to insert a discount **greater than or equal to** the price, PostgreSQL will throw a **violation error**.

---

## 🧪 Example 3: Minimum Age Requirement
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE student (   id INT,   name TEXT,   age INT CHECK (age >= 18) );`

- Ensures that only students **18 years or older** can be registered.
    

### Test:

- Inserting `age = 15` → ❌ Error!
    
- Inserting `age = 27` → ✅ Success!
    

---

## 🧪 Example 4: Multi-Column Age Validation
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE students2 (   id INT,   name TEXT,   min_age INT,   current_age INT,   CHECK (min_age > 0),   CHECK (current_age >= min_age) );`

This example applies **two `CHECK` constraints**:

1. `min_age > 0`: Ensures the minimum age is realistic.
    
2. `current_age >= min_age`: Validates that the current age is at least equal to the minimum.
    

### Test:

- `min_age = 18`, `current_age = 27` → ✅ Valid
    
- `min_age = 18`, `current_age = 15` → ❌ Invalid (throws error)

## 🔍 Summary

|Feature|Explanation|
|---|---|
|`CHECK` Constraint|Validates data using Boolean conditions|
|Syntax|`column_name TYPE CHECK (condition)` or `CONSTRAINT name CHECK (condition)`|
|Multiple Constraints|You can define more than one check per table|
|Common Uses|Positive numbers, discount rules, age validations, logical column relationships|

## 🧠 Tips for Using CHECK Constraints

- Always **test** your constraints by inserting valid and invalid data.
    
- Use **descriptive names** for constraints to make errors more understandable.
    
- `CHECK` constraints help **prevent logical mistakes** in data entry early on.
    
- You can also use `CHECK` to compare values **across multiple columns** in the same row.

## ▶️ What’s Next?

We’ll explore more types of **constraints** in upcoming classes—like `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, and `UNIQUE`. These are all essential for maintaining **data integrity** and building reliable databases.
