## üìò Study Notes: SQL Constraints ‚Äì PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE

### üëã Introduction

Welcome, students! In this lesson, we‚Äôre diving deeper into **SQL constraints**, specifically focusing on:

- `PRIMARY KEY`
    
- `UNIQUE`
    

These constraints are crucial in designing reliable and consistent database tables.

### üîê What is a PRIMARY KEY?

A **Primary Key (PK)** is a **unique identifier** for rows in a table. It ensures that:

- Each row has a **unique** value.
    
- The column(s) cannot be `NULL`.
    

> **Think of it as the ID number of a student ‚Äì no two students should have the same ID.**

#### Key Characteristics:

- Combines two rules: `UNIQUE` + `NOT NULL`.
    
- Automatically creates a **B-Tree index** (for faster searches).
    
- Can be:
    
    - A single column (e.g., `student_id`)
        
    - A **combination of columns** (e.g., `student_id`, `CPF`)
        

#### Syntax Example:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE students (     student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,     name TEXT NOT NULL,     cpf TEXT UNIQUE,     age INT );`

You can also define it at the end of the table:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE students (     student_id INT,     name TEXT,     cpf TEXT,     PRIMARY KEY (student_id) );`

---

### üåü What is a UNIQUE Constraint?

The **UNIQUE constraint** ensures that **no two rows** have the same value in a specific column (or group of columns).

#### Examples of Use:

- Barcode for products
    
- CPF for people (like a national ID)
    
- Email addresses
    

#### Syntax Example:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE products (     product_code INT UNIQUE,     name TEXT,     price NUMERIC );`

You can **name** your constraint for clarity:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE products (     product_code INT CONSTRAINT uq_product_code UNIQUE,     name TEXT,     price NUMERIC );`

Or define it separately at the end:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE students (     student_id INT,     cpf TEXT,     CONSTRAINT uq_cpf UNIQUE (cpf) );`

---

### üß™ Practical Example ‚Äì Student Table

Let‚Äôs walk through creating a `students` table with constraints:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE students (     student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,     name TEXT NOT NULL,     cpf TEXT UNIQUE,     age INT );`

Here‚Äôs what happens:

- `student_id` is the **Primary Key** ‚Äì must be unique and not null.
    
- `cpf` is marked **UNIQUE** ‚Äì ensures no duplicate CPF.
    
- `name` must be provided ‚Äì `NOT NULL`.
    

‚úÖ Inserting a student:
	
	sql
	
`INSERT INTO students (student_id, name, cpf, age) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', '33333333333', 20);`

‚ùå Trying to insert the same `cpf` again:
	
	sql
	
`INSERT INTO students (student_id, name, cpf, age) VALUES (2, 'Jane Smith', '33333333333', 22); -- Error: CPF value already exists!`

---

### üß© Composite Primary Key (Multiple Columns)

You can also use **multiple columns** as a **combined primary key**:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE student_records (     student_id INT,     cpf TEXT,     PRIMARY KEY (student_id, cpf) );`

This means:

- The **combination** of `student_id` and `cpf` must be unique.
    
- Repeating either `student_id` or `cpf` alone is allowed, as long as the pair is unique.
    

---

### üß† Final Thoughts

- Use `PRIMARY KEY` for **identification** of rows.
    
- Use `UNIQUE` to ensure no duplicate values in certain fields (like CPF).
    
- Constraints help maintain **data integrity**.
    
- It's good practice to **name your constraints** for better clarity and debugging.
    
- Use **multiple constraints** when necessary for strong data control.
