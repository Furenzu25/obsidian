## üìö Study Notes: **Foreign Key (FK)** in Relational Databases

### üîë What is a Foreign Key?

- A **foreign key** is a constraint used to **link two tables** together.
    
- It ensures that the value in one column (or a group of columns) **must already exist** in another table.
    
- This enforces **referential integrity** ‚Äî it guarantees that a relationship between records in two tables remains valid.
    

### üß† Purpose of a Foreign Key

- Prevents entries in a table from referencing **nonexistent rows** in a related table.
    
- Makes sure that records in a "child" table correspond to existing records in a "parent" table.
    
- Example:
    
    - You can't create an **order** for a **product** that doesn't exist in the **Products** table.

### üîß Syntax Overview
	
	sql
	
`FOREIGN KEY (column_name) REFERENCES parent_table(parent_column)`

- You define the **foreign key** in the table that needs to reference another table (child table).
    
- `REFERENCES` points to the **parent table** and the column that holds the primary key.

### üõ† Example: Products and Orders Tables
	
	sql
	
`-- Parent Table CREATE TABLE Products (   product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,   name VARCHAR(255) );  -- Child Table with Foreign Key CREATE TABLE Orders (   order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,   product_id INT,   FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES Products(product_id) );`

- **Orders** table references the **Products** table.
    
- You can only insert orders that contain product IDs already in the **Products** table.

### üßë‚Äçüíº Example: Customers and Contacts

#### Customers Table
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE Customers (   customer_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,   name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL );`

#### Contacts Table (with FK)
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE Contacts (   contact_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,   customer_id INT,   name VARCHAR(255),   phone VARCHAR(20),   email VARCHAR(255),   FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customers(customer_id) );`

- Contacts must belong to existing customers.
    
- You **cannot insert** a contact record with a customer ID that doesn‚Äôt exist in the Customers table.
    

---

### ‚ùå Delete and Update Rules (ON DELETE / ON UPDATE)

- By **default**, if you try to delete a parent row (e.g., a customer) that still has child records (e.g., contacts), it will **fail**.
    
- This is because the foreign key constraint prevents breaking the relationship.
    
- Example:
	    
		sql
	    
    `DELETE FROM Customers WHERE customer_id = 1;`
    
    If customer `1` still has contacts, this will return an error unless an `ON DELETE` action is defined.
    

---

### üö´ Default Behavior: `NO ACTION`

- If no specific action is set (`ON DELETE NO ACTION`), trying to delete a referenced record will **throw an error**.
    
- The constraint protects data integrity by **blocking deletion or updates** that would leave orphaned records.
    

---

### ‚úÖ To Allow Deletion with FK:

Use options like:

- `ON DELETE CASCADE`: Deletes related rows automatically.
    
- `ON DELETE SET NULL`: Sets the foreign key in the child table to `NULL`.
    

These are **not** covered in the transcript but were mentioned as **topics for the next lessons**.

---

### üìù Summary Points

- Foreign keys are used to **relate tables** and enforce **data consistency**.
    
- FK values must match **existing PK values** in the referenced table.
    
- You cannot:
    
    - Insert a child record referencing a nonexistent parent.
        
    - Delete a parent record that‚Äôs still referenced in a child table, unless specific actions (`CASCADE`, `SET NULL`, etc.) are defined.
        
- FK constraints are **essential** in relational database design to maintain **referential integrity**.
