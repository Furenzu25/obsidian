## 📘 **Database Indexes – Study Notes**

### 🔹 **Introduction**

- The class is about **indexes in databases**.
    
- We've encountered indexes before, but now we’re focusing on understanding them in depth.
    

---

### 📌 **What is an Index?**

- An **index** is a data structure that helps **speed up database operations**, especially:
    
    - Queries (SELECT)
        
    - Deletions (DELETE)
        
    - Updates (UPDATE)
        
- Think of it like a **book index or table of contents** – instead of flipping through every page, you jump directly to the needed section.

### 🔹 **Why Use Indexes?**

- They help **locate data faster**, especially in large tables.
    
- Without indexes, the database must **scan the entire table** to find data, which is inefficient.

### 🌳 **Main Types of Indexes**

1. ### **BTREE (Default)**
    
    - Most commonly used.
        
    - Works like a **balanced tree**.
        
    - Efficient for range queries, ordered data.
        
    - Good for **read-heavy systems**.
        
    - Used in **PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB**, and more.
        
    - **Logarithmic time** for insertions, deletions, and lookups.
        
2. ### **HASH**
    
    - Useful **only** for exact matches using:
        
        - `=` (equals)
            
        - `!=` (not equals)
            
        - `IN`
            
    - Not suitable for range or sorting queries.
        
    - Very limited in use; rarely used in practice.
        
3. ### **GIST (Generalized Search Tree)**
    
    - Creates **signature-based indexes** (bitwise).
        
    - Can produce **false positives**.
        
    - Useful for complex data types, but not widely used.
        
4. ### **SP-GIST (Space-partitioned GIST)**
    
    - Optimized for **partitioning space**.
        
    - Divides search space into **uneven partitions**.
        
    - Can be faster but also more complex.
        
5. ### **GIN (Generalized Inverted Index)**
    
    - Designed for **full-text searches**.
        
    - Efficient for **documents and arrays**.
        
6. ### **BRIN (Block Range Index)**
    
    - Used with **very large tables**.
        
    - Assumes **physical ordering** of data in columns.
        
    - Lightweight, but only useful under specific conditions.

### 🛠️ **Creating an Index**

#### **Basic Syntax:**
	
	sql
	
`CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name);`

#### Example:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE INDEX idx_address_phone ON address(phone);`

- `idx_address_phone` is the index name (choose something **clear and concise**).
    
- `address` is the table, `phone` is the column being indexed.
    

#### 📝 Notes:

- If you **don’t specify the index type**, PostgreSQL will default to **btree**.
    
- You can specify **ASC/DESC** for sorting, and whether **NULLS FIRST/LAST**.
    
- Indexes help **avoid full table scans**, drastically improving performance.

### 🧪 **Using EXPLAIN to Check Index Usage**

You can use the `EXPLAIN` command to see how a query is executed:
	
	sql
	
`EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM address WHERE phone = '555-1234';`

- Before indexing, the query scans the **entire table**.
    
- After indexing, it uses the index instead – much faster!
    

---

### ✅ **Key Takeaways**

- Indexes are essential for performance, especially on large datasets.
    
- **BTREE** is the go-to index unless you have a specific need.
    
- Indexing improves **query speed** but can **slow down insert/update** operations slightly.
    
- Not all columns need indexes – use them wisely based on query patterns.
