## 📚 Study Notes: PostgreSQL Table Partitioning by Range (Time Intervals)

### 🔍 What is Table Partitioning?

Table partitioning is a technique used to **split large tables** into smaller, more manageable pieces called **partitions**. Each partition stores a **subset** of the original table’s data based on a defined condition—such as a date range.

Partitioning is essential for:

- **Improving query performance**
    
- **Making data management easier**
    
- **Optimizing storage**
    
- **Simplifying backup and restore processes**

### 🛠️ Hands-On: Time-Based (Range) Partitioning

We are focusing on **range partitioning** using **time intervals** (e.g., monthly sales data). This is especially useful for **time-series data** or data with natural chronological order.

---

### 🧱 Step-by-Step Setup

#### 1. **Create the Main (Parent) Table**

We begin by creating a standard table, but without a primary key. This is important because **indexes cannot enforce uniqueness across partitions**.
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE sales (   sales_id INT,   sale_date DATE,   product_id INT,   quantity INT,   amount NUMERIC ) PARTITION BY RANGE (sale_date);`

> ⚠️ **Note:** No primary key or unique constraints should be used on the parent table.

---

#### 2. **Create Partition Tables (Child Tables)**

Each partition represents a specific **date range**.
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE sales_jan PARTITION OF sales   FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-01-01') TO ('2025-02-01');  CREATE TABLE sales_feb PARTITION OF sales   FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-02-01') TO ('2025-03-01');  CREATE TABLE sales_mar PARTITION OF sales   FOR VALUES FROM ('2025-03-01') TO ('2025-04-01');`

> You can add as many partitions as needed—monthly, quarterly, yearly, etc.

---

#### 3. **Add Constraints to Enforce Correct Data Insertion**

Although partitions are created, there's no guarantee that inserted data falls within the correct time range unless we enforce it.

Use `CHECK` constraints to validate that dates match the expected range:
	
	sql
	
`ALTER TABLE sales_jan ADD CONSTRAINT check_jan   CHECK (sale_date >= '2025-01-01' AND sale_date < '2025-02-01');  ALTER TABLE sales_feb ADD CONSTRAINT check_feb   CHECK (sale_date >= '2025-02-01' AND sale_date < '2025-03-01');  ALTER TABLE sales_mar ADD CONSTRAINT check_mar   CHECK (sale_date >= '2025-03-01' AND sale_date < '2025-04-01');`

---

### 📥 Inserting Data

You insert data **into the parent table**, and PostgreSQL will **automatically route** it to the correct partition based on the date.
	
	sql
	
`INSERT INTO sales VALUES (1, '2025-01-15', 101, 3, 150.00); -- goes to sales_jan INSERT INTO sales VALUES (2, '2025-02-20', 102, 1, 75.00);  -- goes to sales_feb INSERT INTO sales VALUES (3, '2025-03-10', 103, 2, 200.00); -- goes to sales_mar`

> 🛑 If the date is **outside the range of defined partitions**, PostgreSQL will raise an error.

---

### 🔎 Querying Partitioned Tables

When you run a query on the parent table, PostgreSQL internally knows which partition(s) to check—making the query faster.
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM sales WHERE sale_date BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-01-31';`

This query only touches `sales_jan`, not the entire dataset.

---

### 💡 Benefits Recap

- **Faster query performance** (limited search scope)
    
- **Easier data management** (smaller, well-defined segments)
    
- **Efficient backups/restores**
    
- **Better use of storage** (older data can be moved to cheaper storage)
    

---

### 🧩 What’s Next?

- Partitioning **by list** (for categories like regions, departments, etc.)
    
- Partitioning **by hash** (for even data distribution when no natural ordering exists)
    

---

### ✅ Final Notes

- Ideal for very large tables (e.g., over 50 million rows)
    
- Easy to implement and expand as needed
    
- Crucial for performance tuning in production systems
