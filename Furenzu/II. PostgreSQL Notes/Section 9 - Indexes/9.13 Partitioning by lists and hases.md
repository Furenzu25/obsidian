### 📘 **Study Notes: Partitioning in PostgreSQL (Lists and Hashes)**

---

#### ✅ **Overview**

Partitioning is a method used in PostgreSQL to divide large tables into smaller, more manageable pieces, improving performance and organization. This lesson focuses on two types of partitioning:

- **List Partitioning**
    
- **Hash Partitioning**

### 📂 **List Partitioning**

#### 🧠 **Concept**

- List partitioning allows you to separate data based on specific, predefined values.
    
- Ideal for **distinct and non-overlapping categories** (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Furniture).
    
- Works similarly to temporal partitioning but with categorical data.
    

#### 🛠️ **Implementation Steps**

1. **Create the Main Table (Parent Table)**:
    
    - Example: `Products` table with columns like `product_id`, `category`, `name`, and `price`.
        
    - Partition the table **by list** on the `category` column.
        
2. **Create Child Tables (Partitions)**:
    
    - Define separate tables for each category:
	        
			sql
	        
        `CREATE TABLE electronics PARTITION OF products FOR VALUES IN ('Electronics'); CREATE TABLE clothing PARTITION OF products FOR VALUES IN ('Clothing'); CREATE TABLE furniture PARTITION OF products FOR VALUES IN ('Furniture');`
        
    - These inherit from the main table and contain only data matching their specified value.
        
3. **Insert Behavior**:
    
    - Data will only insert into a partition **if the value exactly matches** one of the specified ones.
        
    - It’s **case-sensitive** — `'Clothing'` is not the same as `'clothing'`.
        

#### 🔒 **Validation**

- **No need for separate `CHECK` constraints** — PostgreSQL performs **implicit validation**.
    
- If a category doesn't match a defined value, the insert fails.
    

#### 🔍 **Querying**

- You can use a regular `SELECT` on the main table (e.g., `SELECT * FROM products`) and PostgreSQL will handle retrieving data from the correct partition.

### 🔢 **Hash Partitioning**

#### 🧠 **Concept**

- Hash partitioning distributes data **based on a hash function** applied to a column.
    
- Used when you need to **evenly distribute rows** (e.g., for load balancing).
    
- Ideal when you **can’t divide data cleanly by list or range**.
    

#### 🛠️ **Implementation Steps**

1. **Create the Main Table**:
    
    - Example: `Orders` table with columns like `id`, `order_date`, `client_id`, and `total_amount`.
        
    - Partition by **hash on the `client_id`** column.
        
2. **Define Child Tables (Partitions)**:
    
    - Choose how many partitions you want (e.g., 3).
        
    - Use modulus and remainder to define where each row goes:
	        
			sql
	        
        `CREATE TABLE orders1 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 3, REMAINDER 0); CREATE TABLE orders2 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 3, REMAINDER 1); CREATE TABLE orders3 PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES WITH (MODULUS 3, REMAINDER 2);`
        
3. **Data Insertion and Routing**:
    
    - When inserting, PostgreSQL automatically calculates the hash of `client_id` and routes the row to the correct partition.
        
    - Example:
	        
			sql
	        
        `INSERT INTO orders (order_date, client_id, total_amount) VALUES ('2025-06-01', 101, 500.00);`
        
    - You can query individual partitions (e.g., `SELECT * FROM orders3`) to see which data ended up where.

### 📊 **Benefits of Partitioning**

- **Improved Query Performance** for large datasets (especially over 50 million rows).
    
- **Efficient Data Management** — logically organized and easier to maintain.
    
- **Automatic Routing** in hash partitioning for balanced load.

### 📌 **Additional Tips**

- **List partitioning** is easier to understand and manage for categorical data.
    
- **Hash partitioning** is more technical but great for uniform distribution.
    
- Be cautious with **case sensitivity** in list values — PostgreSQL requires exact matches.
    
- You can **check partition sizes** and **view schema details** using PostgreSQL commands like `\d+ tablename`.

### 📘 **Conclusion**

Partitioning in PostgreSQL, whether by **list** or **hash**, is a powerful tool for optimizing large-scale data storage and queries. Each method serves different use cases:

- Use **list** when categories are known and fixed.
    
- Use **hash** when you need even distribution but don’t have clear categorical splits.
    

> For large-scale applications or databases with tens of millions of records, partitioning is **essential** for performance and scalability.
