# üìò PostgreSQL Study Notes: **Indexes on Expressions (Function-Based Indexes)**

---

## üß† What Are Expression Indexes?

- **Expression indexes** (also called **function-based indexes**) are special indexes created **not just on columns**, but on the result of **an expression** applied to a column.
    
- These are **helpful when queries involve expressions** in WHERE or ORDER BY clauses, such as `LOWER(column_name)` or mathematical operations.
    

---

## üß∞ Why Use Expression Indexes?

- Improve **query performance** where expressions are frequently used.
    
- Allow **case-insensitive searches** or customized filtering without scanning the whole table.
    
- **Common use case**: handling **case sensitivity** in text columns (like names or emails).
    

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Consideration

> Expression indexes are **more expensive to maintain**.

- PostgreSQL must **re-evaluate the expression** every time a row is **inserted or updated**.
    
- Use expression indexes only when **read performance** is **more important** than **write performance**.

## üìê Syntax
	
	sql
	
`CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (expression);`

- `index_name`: Name of your new index.
    
- `table_name`: The target table.
    
- `expression`: The function or transformation on a column (e.g. `LOWER(column_name)`).

## üß™ Practical Example: Case-Insensitive Search on Customer Names

### Scenario:

You want to search the `customer` table by `last_name`, but PostgreSQL is **case-sensitive** by default.
	
	sql
	
`-- Will not return 'Purdy' if searched as 'purdy' SELECT customer_id FROM customer WHERE last_name = 'purdy';`

### Step 1: Create an Expression Index
	
	sql
	
`CREATE INDEX idx_lower_lastname ON customer (LOWER(last_name));`

- This creates an index on the lowercase version of the `last_name` column.
    
- Now queries using `LOWER(last_name)` will be faster.
    

### Step 2: Run a Case-Insensitive Query
	
	sql
	
`EXPLAIN SELECT customer_id FROM customer WHERE LOWER(last_name) = 'purdy';`

- The **EXPLAIN** shows that PostgreSQL uses the `idx_lower_lastname` index.
    
- This improves performance and enables **case-insensitive search**.

## üß≠ Summary Table

|Feature|Description|
|---|---|
|Expression Index|Index built on an expression or function|
|Also called|Function-based index|
|Syntax|`CREATE INDEX name ON table (expression)`|
|Example|`CREATE INDEX idx_lower_name ON users(LOWER(name));`|
|Pros|Speeds up queries using functions|
|Cons|Slower insert/update performance|
|Use Case|Case-insensitive searches, computed fields|

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Use **only** when:
    
    - Queries regularly use functions (like `LOWER()`, `DATE_TRUNC()`, etc.).
        
    - Performance improvement in read-heavy workloads is needed.
        
- Avoid **redundant** expression indexes if queries don‚Äôt make use of the expression.
    
- Always **test with EXPLAIN** to confirm the index is being used.

## üëã Conclusion

Expression indexes are a **powerful performance tool** in PostgreSQL, especially when dealing with case sensitivity or computed values. Just remember to balance the **read performance gain** against the **write performance cost**.
