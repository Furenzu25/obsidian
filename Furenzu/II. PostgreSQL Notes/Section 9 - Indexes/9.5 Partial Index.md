## 📘 **Study Notes: Partial Indexes in SQL**

### 🧠 **What is a Partial Index?**

A **Partial Index** is a database index built on a **subset of a table’s rows**, rather than indexing all rows. It uses a **`WHERE` clause** to filter which rows are included in the index.

- ✅ **Improves performance** by reducing index size
    
- ✅ **Speeds up specific queries** that target the filtered condition
    
- ❌ **Not used for every type of query**, only for those that match the filter condition

### ⚙️ **How It Works**

- Instead of indexing an entire table, **Partial Indexes** target only rows that match a **condition**, such as `WHERE active = 0`.
    
- This allows the database to **optimize searches** for that specific subset of data.

### 🔍 **Example Scenario: Customer Table**

Let’s say you have a table called `Customer` with a boolean column `active` (1 = active, 0 = inactive).

#### 🎯 **Goal**:

Find all **inactive customers** (`active = 0`) more efficiently.

#### 👎 Without Index:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name, email FROM Customer WHERE active = 0;`

- The query scans the whole table (slow).
    
- `EXPLAIN` will show **no index is used**.
    

#### 👍 With a Partial Index:

Create an index that only includes inactive customers:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE INDEX idx_inactive_customers ON Customer (active) WHERE active = 0;`

- Now, when you run the same query, the database uses this partial index.
    
- Query becomes **faster** and **more efficient**.
    
- Running `EXPLAIN` now shows that the partial index is being used.

### 🧪 **Advanced Usage**

Partial indexes are **flexible**:

- You can filter based on conditions like:
    
    - `WHERE amount < 10000`
        
    - `WHERE status = 'pending'`
        
    - `WHERE ip_address NOT BETWEEN '192.80.100' AND '192.85.55'`
        

This allows you to **tailor indexes** for your most frequent or performance-critical queries.

### 💡 **Takeaways**

- Use **partial indexes** to improve performance **when queries often filter on specific values**.
    
- Helps **reduce index size** while still offering speed benefits.
    
- Always use `EXPLAIN` to verify if your indexes are being used effectively.
