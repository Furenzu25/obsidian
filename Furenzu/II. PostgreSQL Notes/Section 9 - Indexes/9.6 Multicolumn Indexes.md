## üìò **Study Notes: Multicolumn Indexes in SQL**

---

### üß† **What is a Multicolumn Index?**

A **Multicolumn Index** (also known as a **composite**, **combined**, or **concatenated index**) is an index built on **two or more columns** of a table.

- Used to **speed up searches** involving more than one column.
    
- Can include **up to 32 columns** by default (PostgreSQL), but this limit can be changed at compile time.
    
- Only works with certain index types, like **GiST** and **GIN**.
    

---

### üß© **Why Use Multicolumn Indexes?**

- Helpful when queries frequently filter using **more than one column**.
    
- Particularly useful when one column is **not very selective** (e.g., first names), but paired with a more selective one (e.g., last names).

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Syntax and Rules**
	
	sql
	
`CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column1, column2);`

> ‚úÖ Order matters: the index is most efficient when queries use **columns from left to right** as defined in the index.

#### üö´ Be careful:

- Logical errors in the `WHERE` clause (like `b = v2 = v3`) are invalid.
    
- You must use logical connectors like `AND`, e.g.:
    
	
	sql
	
`WHERE b = v2 AND c = v3`

### üß™ **Example: People Table**

Let's say we create a table called `people`:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE TABLE people (   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,   first_name VARCHAR NOT NULL,   last_name VARCHAR NOT NULL );`

Then we insert **100,000 random names** into the table.

### üîç **Use Case: Optimizing Queries**

If most of your searches are based on `last_name`, it makes sense to create a multicolumn index:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE INDEX idx_people_lastname_firstname ON people (last_name, first_name);`

This index will improve:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM people WHERE last_name = 'Adams';`

And also:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM people WHERE last_name = 'Adams' AND first_name = 'Lou';`

You can check if the index is used with:
	
	sql
	
`EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM people WHERE last_name = 'Adams';`

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note on Column Order**

- If your index is on `(last_name, first_name)`, a query **just on `last_name`** works well.
    
- A query **just on `first_name`** will likely **not use** the index.
    

So, **define your index based on the most commonly searched columns**, and place the **most selective column first**.

---

### üß† **Takeaways**

- Multicolumn indexes can **significantly improve performance** for queries involving multiple columns.
    
- Always analyze **query patterns** to decide the best column order in the index.
    
- Use `EXPLAIN` to confirm whether the index is being used.

That wraps up this lesson on **Multicolumn Indexes**. They‚Äôre a powerful optimization tool when used wisely. Keep practicing and explore your queries with `EXPLAIN` to learn how indexing impacts performance! üöÄ
