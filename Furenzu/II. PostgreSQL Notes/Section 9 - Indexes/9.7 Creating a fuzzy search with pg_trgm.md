## ðŸ”¹ Multicolumn (Composite) Indexes

### âœ… What is a Multicolumn Index?

- A **multicolumn index** (also known as composite or concatenated index) is an index on **two or more columns** of a table.
    
- PostgreSQL allows up to **32 columns** in a multicolumn index (this can be increased at compile time).
    

### âœ… Syntax
	
	sql
	
`CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column1, column2, ...);`

### âœ… Best Practices

- Useful when **queries often filter by multiple columns**.
    
- **Order matters**: the most frequently used column in `WHERE` should come first.
    
- Example:
	    
		sql
	    
    `CREATE INDEX idx_people_lastname_firstname ON people (last_name, first_name);`
    

### âœ… Important Note on WHERE Clause

- When querying with multicolumn indexes, make sure to **specify all required conditions correctly** in the `WHERE` clause.
    
- Use `AND` properly (e.g., `WHERE last_name = 'Smith' AND first_name = 'John'`).
    
- Incorrect syntax or skipping logical operators can lead to errors or the index not being used.
    

### âœ… Practical Example

1. A table `people` with columns `id`, `first_name`, and `last_name` is created.
    
2. Inserted **100,000 random names**.
    
3. An index is created on `last_name, first_name`.
    
4. When running queries like:
	    
		sql
	    
    `SELECT * FROM people WHERE last_name = 'Adams';`
    
    or
	    
		sql
	    
    `SELECT * FROM people WHERE last_name = 'Adams' AND first_name = 'Lou';`
    
    PostgreSQL uses the index to **speed up searches**.
    
5. You can confirm index usage using:
	    
		sql
	    
    `EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM people WHERE last_name = 'Adams';`

## ðŸ”¹ Fuzzy Search with `pg_trgm`

### âœ… What is Fuzzy Search?

- Fuzzy Search finds **approximate string matches** rather than exact ones.
    
- Useful when users might **misspell** or **partially remember** data.
    

### âœ… Required Extension
	
	sql
	
`CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm;`

- `pg_trgm` enables fuzzy text matching using **trigrams** (three-letter sequences).
    

### âœ… How It Works

- Strings are broken down into **trigrams** (e.g., `hello` â†’ `hel`, `ell`, `llo`).
    
- It compares trigrams between the search string and target data to calculate **similarity** (a number between 0 and 1).
    
    - **Closer to 1** = more similar.
        
    - **Closer to 0** = less similar.
        

### âœ… Using Fuzzy Search

Example:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM location ORDER BY name <-> 'Adams' LIMIT 10;`

- `<->` is the **similarity distance operator**.
    

You can also use:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM location WHERE name % 'Adams';`

- `%` is a fuzzy match operator that returns strings **similar** to 'Adams'.
    

Use `EXPLAIN` to see if the index is being utilized:
	
	sql
	
`EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM location WHERE name % 'Adams';`

### âœ… Using Indexes with Trigrams

To make fuzzy searches faster:
	
	sql
	
`CREATE INDEX idx_trgm_name ON location USING gist (name gist_trgm_ops);`

- This creates a **GiST index** based on trigrams.
    

### âœ… Searching with LIKE and Trigrams

You can still use:
	
	sql
	
`SELECT * FROM location WHERE name LIKE '%ber%';`

- But itâ€™s much faster when using the **trigram-based index**.
    

### âœ… Regex with Trigrams

- Trigram indexes can also **speed up regex-based searches**:
	    
		sql
	    
    `SELECT * FROM location WHERE name ~* 'ber';`

## ðŸ”š Summary

- **Multicolumn indexes** are powerful when your queries filter on **multiple columns**, especially in a specific order.
    
- **Fuzzy Search** improves the user experience when the search input is uncertain or contains typos.
    
- The `pg_trgm` extension enables **approximate string matching**, and pairing it with a **GiST index** significantly improves performance.
    
- Tools like `EXPLAIN` help validate that your indexes are used correctly.
