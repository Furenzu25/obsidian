### 📘 Study Notes: Understanding the `EXPLAIN` Command in PostgreSQL

#### 📌 What is `EXPLAIN`?

The `EXPLAIN` command in PostgreSQL is a diagnostic tool used to **analyze and visualize how a SQL query will be executed** by the database engine. It helps developers and DBAs understand the **execution plan** without actually running the query.

#### 🔍 Purpose of `EXPLAIN`

- Generates a **QUERY PLAN** — a map of how PostgreSQL intends to execute the given SQL statement.
    
- **Does not execute** the actual query, making it safe for performance testing.
    
- Helps in **query optimization** by showing:
    
    - The path PostgreSQL chooses (e.g., sequential scan, index scan)
        
    - Estimated costs
        
    - Row estimates
        
    - Data width (in bytes)

### 🧠 Key Concepts in the QUERY PLAN

Each line in the plan corresponds to a **node** in the execution tree. Nodes can be things like sequential scans (`Seq Scan`), sorts, joins, etc. Here's what the different metrics mean:

#### 1. **Node Type**

- Examples: `Seq Scan`, `Index Scan`, `Sort`
    
- Represents a step in how the data is accessed or processed.
    

#### 2. **Cost**

- Shown as: `cost=Startup..Total`
    
- **Startup cost**: How much effort is needed before the node can begin returning data.
    
- **Total (Final) cost**: How much effort is required to return all results from the node.
    

📝 _Example_:  
`cost=0.00..18.50`

- Startup cost = `0.00` (can begin immediately)
    
- Final cost = `18.50` (total effort to complete execution of that node)
    

#### 3. **Rows**

- An estimate of the **number of tuples** (rows) the node will return.
    
- It's only an estimate and **not guaranteed** to be accurate.
    
- PostgreSQL will never assume `0` rows — the lowest it can estimate is `1`.
    

#### 4. **Width**

- Represents the **average size (in bytes)** of each tuple returned.
    
- Useful for estimating memory usage of a query.
    
- Example: `width=78` means each row is approximately 78 bytes.

### ⚙️ Example Use Case

#### Basic EXPLAIN:
	
	sql
	
`EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM categories;`

- Output: Simple `Seq Scan` over the `categories` table
    
- Displays basic cost, rows, and width values
    

#### With Sorting:
	
	sql
	
`EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM categories ORDER BY title DESC;`

- Adds a `Sort` node above the `Seq Scan` node
    
- The `Sort` node has its own cost and is **indented** in the plan to show hierarchy
    
- Higher startup and total costs due to sorting operation

### 🧩 Visual Structure of EXPLAIN Output

- **Indented nodes** indicate execution order
    
- **Arrows** (→) show data flow from bottom nodes (like scans) to higher ones (like sorts)
    
- Output order matches **execution hierarchy** — bottom-up

### 💡 Final Insights

- The `EXPLAIN` tool is essential for **understanding performance bottlenecks**.
    
- Focus on interpreting:
    
    - **Execution nodes**
        
    - **Cost estimations**
        
    - **Tuple (row) and width predictions**
        
- Learn to **identify inefficiencies** such as expensive sorts, missing indexes, or large row widths.
