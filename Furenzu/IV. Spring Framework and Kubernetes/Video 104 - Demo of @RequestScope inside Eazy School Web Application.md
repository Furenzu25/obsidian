# 🌐 Study Notes: Use Cases & Precautions for Spring Web Bean Scopes

---

## 📌 Overview

Spring provides **Web Bean Scopes** to control how long a bean lives in a web application context.  
These include:

- 🔁 `@RequestScope`
    
- 🧑‍💻 `@SessionScope`
    
- 🌍 `@ApplicationScope`
    

Each has specific use cases and **performance implications**.

---

## 🔁 1. Request Scope – `@RequestScope`

📌 **Definition**: A new bean instance is created for **every HTTP request**.

### ✅ Use Case:

- Best for **sensitive and short-lived data**.
    
- Example: Login credentials (username/password) should not be stored or reused.
    

### ⚠️ Precautions:

- If your application handles thousands/millions of requests per second, Spring will create **that many beans**.
    
- This leads to:
    
    - High object creation rate.
        
    - More frequent **Garbage Collection (GC)**.
        
    - ⚠️ **Performance degradation**.
        

### ⚙️ Development Tip:

- **Avoid heavy logic** in constructors or initialization blocks.
    
    - These beans are short-lived, and heavy logic slows down every request.

## 🧑‍💻 2. Session Scope – `@SessionScope`

📌 **Definition**: One bean instance per **user session**. Lives as long as the session exists.

### ✅ Use Case:

- Best when you want to **persist data across multiple pages or requests** for the same user.
    
- Example: A banking web app showing user info (e.g., name, account number) in a top header.
    

### ⚠️ Precautions:

- Store only **lightweight data** (like text or IDs).
    
- ❌ Avoid storing images, files, or large binary data.
    
    - These can bloat memory and hurt performance.
        

---

## 🌍 3. Application Scope – `@ApplicationScope`

📌 **Definition**: One bean instance for the **entire servlet context**. Shared across all users and sessions.

### ✅ Use Case:

- Storing **global, static, or read-only data** that is common to everyone.
    
- Example: Dropdown values like countries, states, or currency options.
    

### ⚠️ Precautions:

- ❗ Shared by all users: any **mutable** state may lead to **race conditions**.
    
- Prefer using **immutable objects**.
    
- ❌ Don’t store large datasets. It’s better to use:
    
    - A **cache layer** (e.g., Redis)
        
    - Or **fetch from DB** as needed.
        

### 🔍 Difference from Singleton:

|Singleton Scope|Application Scope|
|---|---|
|One bean per **ApplicationContext**|One bean per **ServletContext**|
|Allows multiple instances (if multiple contexts)|One true instance per web app runtime|

## 🧠 Quick Summary Table

|Scope|Bean Lifetime|When to Use|Common Pitfalls|
|---|---|---|---|
|🔁 RequestScope|Per HTTP request|Short-lived, sensitive data|High GC load, avoid heavy logic|
|🧑‍💻 SessionScope|Per user session|Persisting user data during a session|Avoid large/binary data storage|
|🌍 ApplicationScope|Entire web app|Shared global data (static/dropdowns)|Avoid mutable state, race conditions|

---

## 🔒 Best Practices

- ✅ Use **RequestScope** for credentials or any input that shouldn't persist.
    
- ✅ Use **SessionScope** for data needed across multiple pages (e.g., user profile).
    
- ✅ Use **ApplicationScope** _only_ when data is:
    
    - Lightweight
        
    - Shared by all users
        
    - Immutable
        

> 💡 Tip: Always be mindful of **memory usage and thread safety** when choosing your bean scope.
