## 🧭 Spring Supports Multiple Development Patterns

Spring is **not just one framework**—it's an umbrella of projects tailored to various modern web development needs:

### ⚙️ Traditional Web Development

- 📦 Spring MVC
    
- 🔐 Spring Security
    
- 🗃️ Spring Data
    

### 🚀 Modern Web Needs

- 🧩 **Microservices** → via Spring Boot & Spring Cloud
    
- 🔁 **Reactive Programming** → non-blocking, asynchronous web apps
    
- ☁️ **Cloud-Ready Apps** → support for AWS, GCP, Azure
    
- 🔥 **Serverless** → integrates with serverless platforms like AWS Lambda
    
- ⚡ **Event-Driven Systems** → real-time data streaming and event responses
    
- 📊 **Batch Processing** → using Spring Batch for large data jobs
    

> 🎯 No matter what your architectural style is, **Spring has a project** to support it!

## 💡 Project Examples: In-Depth

### 🔎 Spring Boot

- Creates web apps in **minutes**.
    
- Handles configuration & dependency setup.
    
- Ideal for **microservices and MVPs**.
    

### 📦 Spring Data

- Works with **SQL & NoSQL**.
    
- Avoids boilerplate code.
    
- Sub-projects let you connect to various DBs: MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.
    

### ☁️ Spring Cloud

- Tailored for **microservices architecture**.
    
- Sub-projects like:
    
    - Spring Cloud Config
        
    - Spring Cloud Gateway
        
    - Cloud deployments (AWS, GCP, Azure, Alibaba)
        

> 📘 Advanced topics like **service discovery, API gateways, config servers** are covered under Spring Cloud.
