## 🧠 **Understanding Race Conditions & Singleton Bean Scope in Spring**

Before diving into when and where to use **Singleton** beans in Spring, it's crucial to understand a fundamental issue that can arise with improper implementation: **Race Conditions** ⚠️.

---

### 💥 What is a Race Condition?

A **race condition** occurs when **two or more threads** access and modify the **same shared data** at the same time. Because these threads "race" to complete their operations, this can lead to unpredictable and **inconsistent behavior** in your application.

#### 👇 Example Scenario:

Imagine a **shared object**, such as a `reservedTables` `HashMap`, used by all threads in your app.

- 👤 **Thread 1** and 👥 **Thread 2** both check the same condition:
    
    java
    
    CopyEdit
    
    `if (!reservedTables.containsKey("Table1"))`
    
- Since `reservedTables` is initially empty, **both** threads find the condition to be `true` ✅.
    
- Thread 1 assigns **Table1** to **User1**.
    
- At the _same time_, Thread 2 assigns **Table1** to **User2**.
    
- Whichever thread updates the map **last** will **override** the previous value. ❌
    

> 📌 The result? Only **User2** gets Table1 in the end, and **User1's** assignment is lost — that's a classic **race condition**.

### 🧾 How Does This Relate to Singleton Beans?

In **Spring**, a **singleton bean** means **only one instance** of the bean exists throughout the application. 🚨

- If multiple threads access a **singleton-scoped bean** that performs data modifications, they **might clash** the same way our table-reservation threads did.
    
- This can lead to bugs, **data corruption**, and hard-to-trace behavior in your app.

### 🔐 How to Prevent Race Conditions?

In **Java**, race conditions can be handled using:

- **Synchronized blocks** or methods
    
- **Locking mechanisms**
    

However, 🧱 **synchronization in Spring beans can be complex**, unnecessary, and should generally be **avoided unless absolutely required**.

---

### ✅ Best Practice:

Before you define a bean as `@Scope("singleton")`, ask yourself:

- Does this bean update, delete, or modify shared data? 🧩
    
- Will it be accessed by multiple threads at the same time? 🧵🧵
    
- Could its logic cause race conditions? 🧠
    

If **yes**, consider:

- Using **prototype scope** instead,
    
- Or redesigning to ensure **thread-safety** without shared mutable state.
    

---

### 🎯 Summary:

- 🕹️ Race conditions = multiple threads updating the same data at once.
    
- 🧨 Singleton beans in Spring can cause race conditions if they manage shared, mutable data.
    
- 🧰 Preventing this often requires synchronization, which complicates Spring development.
    
- 🛡️ Carefully evaluate your bean’s responsibilities before choosing singleton scope.
