## 📘 Study Note: Understanding AOP Jargons in Spring Framework

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) introduces a few new terms that can seem overwhelming at first. But don’t worry — once you break them down, they’re very intuitive and powerful! Here’s a structured guide to help you understand the **key AOP jargons** used in Spring.

### 🎯 Start with the 3 W’s of AOP

Whenever you're implementing AOP, remember to figure out the **three W’s**:

---

#### 1️⃣ **WHAT** — The Logic You Want to Execute

🟢 This is your **Aspect**.

- It represents the _non-business_ logic (like logging, security, or auditing) you want Spring to automatically run.
    
- ✅ Think of it as: _“What logic do I want to inject?”_
    

🧠 _Example:_ Logging system events, checking permissions, recording audits.

---

#### 2️⃣ **WHEN** — When Should the Logic Run?

🟠 This is your **Advice**.

- It tells Spring _when_ to run the aspect — _before_, _after_, or _around_ method execution.
    
- ✅ Think of it as: _“When should the logic run in relation to the target method?”_
    

🧠 _Example:_ Run logging before the method runs ➡️ `@Before`

---

#### 3️⃣ **WHICH** — Which Method Should Be Intercepted?

🔵 This is your **Pointcut**.

- Specifies **which methods** should be intercepted by the aspect.
    
- ✅ Think of it as: _“Which methods will trigger my aspect logic?”_
    

🧠 _Example:_ Intercept only `playMusic()` method in the `VehicleService` bean.

---

### ➕ Other Key AOP Terms

Besides the main 3 W’s, there are **two more jargons** you'll encounter occasionally:

---

#### 📍 **Join Point**

- A specific **point in execution** where an aspect can be applied.
    
- In Spring (Java-based), this is usually a **method call**.
    
- ✅ Think of it as: _“The exact place where Spring can apply the aspect.”_
    

🧠 _Example:_ The actual call to `playMusic()`.

---

#### 🎯 **Target Object**

- The **actual bean** whose method is being intercepted.
    
- ✅ Think of it as: _“Which object contains the business logic being advised?”_
    

🧠 _Example:_ The `VehicleService` bean that holds `playMusic()`.

---

### 🔁 Real-Life Example to Understand All Terms

**Statement:**  
_A developer wants some logic to be executed before each execution of the `playMusic()` method in the `VehicleService` bean._

Let’s break this down:

|AOP Term|Meaning in Context|
|---|---|
|🟢 **Aspect**|The logic we want to run (e.g., logging)|
|🟠 **Advice**|When we run it: **before** method execution|
|🔵 **Pointcut**|The method: `playMusic()`|
|📍 **Join Point**|The _actual execution_ of `playMusic()`|
|🎯 **Target Object**|The `VehicleService` bean|

---

### 🔑 Key Takeaways

- **Aspect** = The “what” ➡️ non-business logic like logging
    
- **Advice** = The “when” ➡️ before/after/around execution
    
- **Pointcut** = The “which” ➡️ method(s) to intercept
    
- **Join Point** = The _actual_ execution moment
    
- **Target Object** = The bean that holds the method

### 📌 Pro Tip:

> 🧩 _AOP helps you write cleaner code by isolating non-functional requirements like logging and security into reusable components that don’t clutter your core logic._

Revisit this breakdown regularly, especially when you feel lost with AOP configurations in Spring! The terms will become second nature with practice. 💡✅
