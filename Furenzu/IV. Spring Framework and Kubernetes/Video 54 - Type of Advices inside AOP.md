## 🧵 Study Note: Understanding **Weaving** in AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)

In this lesson, we explore the magical ✨ concept of **Weaving** — a core mechanism behind how Spring AOP applies aspect logic into your application methods seamlessly.

---

### 🔍 What is Weaving?

Weaving is the **process of connecting aspects (extra logic like logging, security, etc.) to your main code (business logic methods)** at specific execution points.

In the context of Spring AOP, **weaving is made possible through the use of Proxy Objects** 🧿.

### 🎭 The Role of Proxy Objects

Here’s how it works:

1. **Without AOP:**
    
    - When you call a method (e.g., `playMusic()` inside `VehicleService`), Spring calls it **directly**.
        
    - 🚫 No interception.
        
    - ✅ Normal method execution.
        
2. **With AOP:**
    
    - Once you apply an aspect to `playMusic()`, Spring will no longer return the original bean reference.
        
    - Instead, Spring provides a **proxy object** 🤖 that stands in for the original bean (`VehicleService` in this case).
        
    - Every time `playMusic()` is called, the **proxy intercepts** the call first.

### ⚙️ How Weaving Happens (Step-by-Step)

Here’s the simplified sequence:

1. 🎯 You apply AOP to a method (e.g., `playMusic()`).
    
2. 📥 Spring returns a **proxy** instead of the actual bean.
    
3. 🔄 Method calls go to the **proxy**, not the original method directly.
    
4. 🧠 The proxy checks:
    
    - Is there an aspect logic configured (e.g., logging)?
        
    - When should it execute? (advice)
        
5. 📌 The proxy:
    
    - Executes the aspect logic first (e.g., log something).
        
    - Then decides whether to **delegate the actual call** to `playMusic()` based on the configuration.
        
6. 🛠️ Spring injects this proxy bean wherever the original bean is needed (via Autowiring or Dependency Injection).

### 🧠 Key Concept: **Weaving = Interception via Proxy**

|Concept|Meaning|
|---|---|
|🧵 **Weaving**|The process of injecting aspect logic into the method call using a proxy|
|🤖 **Proxy Object**|A special object created by Spring to intercept method calls|
|🧩 **Interception**|Spring captures method calls to apply aspect logic before actual execution|

---

### 📝 Recap

- Spring **intercepts** method calls using **proxy objects**.
    
- This interception mechanism is called **Weaving**.
    
- Without AOP: Method runs normally.
    
- With AOP: Proxy steps in ➡️ runs the aspect logic ➡️ then calls the actual method.
    
- This all happens dynamically at **runtime**, powered by Spring Framework.
