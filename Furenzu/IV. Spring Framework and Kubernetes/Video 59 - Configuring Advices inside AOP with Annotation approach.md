## 🔄 AOP Configuration: Annotation-Based Advisor Setup in Spring

So far, we've explored configuring **advisors** in Spring AOP using the `execution` expression approach. However, there's **another powerful method**—using **custom annotations** 🎯.

### ✅ Steps to Configure AOP with Annotations

1. **🛠️ Create a Custom Annotation**
    
    - Define your own annotation (e.g., `@LogAspect`).
        
    - Use `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)` so that Spring can intercept the method **at runtime**.
        
    - Apply `@Target(ElementType.METHOD)` to specify the annotation applies to **methods only**.
        
    
    `java`
    
	    @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.METHOD) public @interface LogAspect { }
    
2. **🏷️ Annotate Your Business Logic Method**
    
    - Place your custom annotation (e.g., `@LogAspect`) on any method where you want AOP logic to be applied.
        
    - Example: Adding it to `playMusic()` indicates Spring should weave aspect logic there.
        
    
    `java`
	
	    @LogAspect public void playMusic() {     // business logic }
    
3. **🧩 Create the Aspect Logic**
    
    - In your Aspect class, use `@Around` (or `@Before`, `@After`, etc.) to define where and how the logic applies.
        
    - Instead of the `execution(...)` expression, use `@annotation(...)` to point to your custom annotation.
        
    - Specify the **full package path** of the annotation:
        
        `com.example.interfaces.LogAspect`
        
    
    `java`
	
	    @Around("@annotation(com.example.interfaces.LogAspect)") public Object logExecution(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {     // aspect logic here     return joinPoint.proceed(); }

### 🧠 When to Use Each Approach

- **Use `execution(...)`**:
    
    - When you want to apply AOP logic to **many methods across packages**.
        
    - Best for wide coverage or broad conditions.
        
- **Use Custom Annotation**:
    
    - When targeting **specific methods only**.
        
    - Ideal when `execution(...)` expressions become too complex or verbose.

### 📌 Summary

🔸 Annotation-based AOP in Spring is a **precise, declarative** approach for applying aspect logic.

🔸 It enhances **readability** and **control**, especially when AOP is required for **a limited set of methods**.

🔸 This method lets you decouple the AOP logic cleanly using **custom annotations** and makes your codebase **modular and expressive**.
