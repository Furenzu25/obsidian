## 🧩 Spring AOP: Implementing an Aspect Using Custom Annotations

In this session, we **implemented an aspect using the annotation-based approach** in Spring AOP. This offers greater **precision** and **control** over which methods get advised.

### 🛠 Step-by-Step: Creating an Annotation-Based Aspect

1. **🔧 Define a Custom Annotation**
    
    - We start by creating an annotation, e.g., `@LogAspect`, using:
        
        java
        
	        public @interface LogAspect { }
        
    - Add:
        
        - `@Target(ElementType.METHOD)` ➝ to restrict annotation use to **methods**
            
        - `@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)` ➝ to ensure it works **at runtime**, as required by AOP
            
2. **🏷 Apply the Annotation to a Business Method**
    
    - Add `@LogAspect` to the method you want to intercept, like:
        
        `java`
		
	        @LogAspect public void playMusic() { ... }
        
3. **📌 Create an Aspect with Annotation-Based Advice**
    
    - In your `LoggerAspect` class:
        
        - Define a method like `logWithAnnotation(...)`
            
        - Use `@Around` with `@annotation(...)` to bind the aspect to the custom annotation
            
    
    Example:
    
    `java`
	
    `@Around("@annotation(com.example.interfaces.LogAspect)") public Object logWithAnnotation(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {     // Aspect logic here     return joinPoint.proceed(); }`

### 🧪 Execution Example & Behavior

- When running the example:
    
    - Only methods annotated with `@LogAspect` (like `playMusic`) trigger the `logWithAnnotation` aspect.
        
    - Other methods are **not affected**, because they lack the annotation.
        
    - A test with breakpoints shows that `logWithAnnotation` is triggered, but the older `log` method using `execution(...)` is not—because of an **intentional package mismatch** for testing.

### ✅ Key Insights & Comparison

|Feature|`execution(...)` Approach|`@annotation(...)` Approach|
|---|---|---|
|**Scope**|Broad, applies to many methods via pattern matching|Targeted, applies only to annotated methods|
|**Flexibility**|Great for large-scale method coverage|Ideal for fine-grained control|
|**Ease of Use**|Quick for bulk configuration|Better for explicit, method-level logic|

### 📚 Final Recommendations

- 💡 **Explore Example 17**: Review and run the code to reinforce the concepts and see both approaches in action.
    
- 🧪 **Experiment**: Add new annotations, change package names, and introduce new aspect methods to deepen understanding.
    
- 📖 **Official Documentation**: There’s a wealth of Spring AOP examples and configurations online. It’s a great place to explore when facing real-world scenarios.

### 🏁 Wrap-Up

Using annotations in Spring AOP:

- Provides **clear visibility** of where AOP logic applies
    
- Helps **modularize concerns** cleanly
    
- Makes **future debugging and maintenance easier**
