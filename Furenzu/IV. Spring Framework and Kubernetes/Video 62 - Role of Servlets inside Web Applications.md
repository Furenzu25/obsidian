## 🧩 The Role of Servlets in Web Applications (Pre-Spring vs. Spring Era)

---

### 📌 Recap: Servlet Container

In the last discussion, we learned:

- Web clients (browsers, apps) communicate using **HTTP**
    
- Java requires **Servlet Containers** (e.g., **Apache Tomcat**) to **translate HTTP messages** into Java objects like `ServletRequest` and `ServletResponse`.
    

Now, we dive deeper into **Servlets themselves** and how **web development used to work** before Spring Framework.

### 🕰️ Life Before Spring Framework

#### 🔧 Manual Servlet Handling

Before Spring existed, **developers had to create a servlet for each URL** endpoint in the application:

🧪 Example:

- `/home` → `HomeServlet`
    
- `/login` → `LoginServlet`
    
- `/dashboard` → `DashboardServlet`
    

Each servlet:

- Handled one specific URL path.
    
- Was mapped manually using **`web.xml`** configuration.
    
- Required a lot of **boilerplate and repetitive code**.

`<servlet-mapping>   <url-pattern>/login</url-pattern>   <servlet-name>LoginServlet</servlet-name> </servlet-mapping>`

🛠️ When deployed:

- The **Servlet Container** (like Tomcat) read the `web.xml`
    
- Mapped incoming HTTP requests to the correct servlet
    
- Transformed requests ➝ `ServletRequest` ➝ executed servlet logic
    
- Transformed response ➝ `ServletResponse` ➝ sent back to client
    

This approach was **tedious and error-prone**, especially for large-scale applications.

### ⚡ Spring Framework Revolution

Spring eliminated this burden with its **built-in Dispatcher Servlet** 🎉

#### 🔄 Dispatcher Servlet

- Developers **no longer need to write servlets manually**
    
- No need to map URLs in `web.xml`
    
- **Spring auto-handles routing** through its central component:
    
    📌 `DispatcherServlet`
    

This single servlet:

- Accepts **all HTTP requests**
    
- Automatically routes them to the correct controller method
    
- Handles conversion between objects and HTTP messages
    
- Integrates with Spring MVC to simplify app structure
    

🔍 Minimal configuration is needed — Spring scans your codebase and wires everything together ✨

### 🧠 Why Still Learn About Servlets?

Even though modern developers **rarely write servlets manually**, it’s still important to:

✅ Understand what happens **behind the scenes**  
✅ Know how HTTP requests are **processed and dispatched**  
✅ Appreciate the **abstraction** Spring provides over traditional servlet mechanisms

> 🚫 Spring **didn’t remove servlets** — it simply moved the responsibility from the **developer** ➝ to the **framework**.

### 📌 Key Takeaways

- 🧱 Before Spring: one servlet per path, manual mapping in `web.xml`
    
- ⚙️ Servlet Container handled request-routing and execution
    
- 🌱 With Spring: single `DispatcherServlet` handles all paths
    
- 💡 Spring simplified web development by abstracting away servlet boilerplate
    
- 🎓 Understanding servlets helps grasp how Spring apps work internally

> 🎯 TL;DR: You don’t _write_ servlets anymore, but **they still power your Spring applications** under the hood.
